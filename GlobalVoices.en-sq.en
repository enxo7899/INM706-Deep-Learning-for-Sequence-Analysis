South Korea: North Korean Dictator, Kim Jong Il Is Dead · Global Voices
Kim Jong Il, the North Korean dictator who ruled the hermit kingdom for the past three decades, has died at the age of 69.
According to North Korean state television's official report on Monday, Kim passed away from "mental and physical strain" during a train ride on December 17, 2011.
The South Korean Twittersphere erupted with various responses.
Although the death of one of the world's most notorious dictators is something people might welcome, most South Koreans have expressed concern about the instability his sudden death might bring to Korean peninsula.
The South Korean public's initial response to the news was pure shock.

Arab World: A Year In Pictures - Our Authors' Selection · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage: Bahrain Protests 2011 Egypt Revolution 2011 Morocco Protests 2011 Syria Protests 2011 Tunisia Revolution 2011 Yemen Protests 2011 Since Mohamed Bouazizi, a young Tunisian fruit vendor set himself on fire in the small city of Sidi Bouzid on December 2010, a wave of unprecedented popular protests is sweeping the Arab world.
The region has seen unprecedented events that no one could ever imagine witnessing in a lifetime.
Three Arab dictators have been toppled, some others forced to engage in reforms, while in other places the confrontation is proving to be painful and bloody.
In any case, 2011 is likely to remain engraved in the history of the Arab world as the year when people started raising against their oppressive regimes.
As we bid farewell to 2011 and look ahead to 2012, we asked our authors to share with you pictures that in their eyes have marked the past year in their respective countries.
The following selection represents their choices.

Even though Lebanon has not witnessed a revolution in 2011, the Land of the Cedars was highly affected by the developpements and turmoil in the area.
But for Lebanese it's the high cost of living that is haunting them the most.
Following each wage increase by the government and even before the plan is approved by parliament, prices soar tremendously.

The little girl looking up at this Moroccan Superman pausing in front of the parliament seems to be wondering if he can fly.
Maybe he's an ultra-nationalist trying to make a point?
Or maybe he's a supporter of the pro-reforms group February 20?
It doesn't really matter.
Because behind this amazing photo by Amine Hachimoto lies a new reality in Morocco: 2011 is the year when the street has become the theater of nonviolent political expression.
Something that is likely to continue in the years to come.

Syrian Media Activist: 'It Is Terrible and Scary, Aleppo Has Become a Horror City' · Global Voices
Gnaid, center, with his newborn daughter and family.
“Aleppo is alive and will not die!”
This is what video journalist Gnaid wrote on Facebook when he announced the birth of his little daughter, his second child, on Thursday, November 24, 2016.
Both children were born and are growing up under siege.
Earlier last week, Gnaid told Global Voices in a series of communications that the Syrian regime's forces were only a couple of kilometers from his house and that panic has taken over the civilians and the media professionals who are still in eastern Aleppo.
At the time of writing, forces that support President Bashar al-Assad are reported to control most of East Aleppo, having made quick advancements in recent days under the cover of Russian bombardment and the large support of Iranian-backed militias.
Since 2012, the city has been divided between rebel-held East Aleppo and regime-held West Aleppo.
The first barrel bombs to have been dropped by the regime over Aleppo were in December 2013 and since then, many forms of weapons have been used, from chemical weapons to cluster bombs, leaving the eastern part of the city in complete ruins.
A brutal siege was then imposed by the regime in July 2016 as it declared its intentions to retake eastern Aleppo within months.
When Gnaid and his family assessed the possibilities of leaving eastern Aleppo, they found many obstacles.
Going to neighboring Turkey is difficult, and areas of Syria that are held by the regime are dangerous for media activists who fear arrest, torture or even death.
Gnaid remarked that only if he surrendered and held a portrait of Assad he might survive, but his pride and dignity would not allow it.
It is too humiliating for him, he told Global Voices.
So Gnaid and his family decided to stay in eastern Aleppo and continue.
“Tonight, the bombings are very heavy” Gnaid said on Wednesday, December 7.
“It is terrible and scary, Aleppo has become a horror city.”
He accused the international community of having "a lack of humanity":
My wife and I don’t have passports.
We cannot travel, but we could keep ourselves alive here in Aleppo, even during the siege.
There has to be a solution now.
It’s our right to live in dignity and freedom, just like all people in this world.
But unfortunately our voice is not heard over the sound of the weapons!
An enormous number of people have lost their houses and are driven away by the violence and the bombs.
Maybe our neighborhood will return to the regime.
But we will hold on to our land!
The shame is on the United Nations and all international organizations who could rescue the wounded but simply refuse to do so!
Gnaid then sent another message:
The situation is terribly difficult.
I don’t know what to say.
I am looking at the people.
I do not want to leave.
I do not want to leave Aleppo.
I am tired and utterly exhausted.
But there is nothing else to do for me than to stay.
This is my land.
There is nothing else for me than Aleppo.
I don’t know what to do anymore.
It’s in God’s hands.
Finally, on Thursday, December 8, Gnaid sent what he thought would be his last message.
Half an hour ago the fighting started here.
There is an enormous panic.
Especially with the children.
It is very very difficult now.
There are rocket attacks by the Syrian Army.
Soon there will be a battle now.
Fortunately, he managed to send a short audio note to Global Voices on the morning of Tuesday, December 13, saying:
We are okay thankfully.
We're still waiting to see what's going to happen to us.
Meanwhile, his colleagues at the Aleppo Media Center uploaded a 360-degree video to show the wide-spread destruction of the area of Al Shaer neighborhood in eastern Aleppo.
For Gnaid and his family, the international community is doing nothing to stop the bloodshed.
The only hope now, he says, is that he and his family can get out safely to the remaining opposition-held areas, hoping that the warplanes don’t follow the people there eventually.
Censorship Meets Rare Defiance as Journalists Strike in China · Global Voices
January 6, 2013 will be remembered in China's journalism history as the day Southern Weekend, a highly acclaimed newspaper that once lead the wave of media reform in China, fell from grace.
At around 9:30pm the newspaper’s official Sina Weibo microblog account issued a statement addressed "To Readers", which denied the provincial propaganda department's role in the recent censorship and rewriting of its New Year editorial.
One hour later, a legion from the current editorial staff announced a strike and distanced themselves from the "To Readers" statement by making a joint statement through a 163.com microblog account, declaring that the official microblog account had been forcefully taken over.
To show their support, many influential public intellectuals and journalists on Sina Weibo changed their profile pictures to a black and white version of the Southern Weekend logo.
A group of journalism students in China expressed their support for Southern Weekend.

Inside the Incident
The following day, the editorial team of Southern Weekend published a long microblog on 163.com, specifying how the “To Readers” statement came about.
Initially, the management of Southern Weekend and the staff were on the same page, and agreed to do a thorough investigation of the revision incident.
However, under pressure from the Guangdong Province propaganda ministry, Wang Genghui, the deputy editor of Nanfang Media (which own Southern Weekend) and Huang Can, a member of the group’s editorial committee and acting editor-in-chief of Southern Weekend asked the editorial team to post the “To Readers” statement that distorted the facts.
Wu Wei (@风端), the person responsible for Southern Weekend's official blog, disagreed with the move, but finally turned in the account and password and announced on his personal microblog that he will not assume responsibility for the content posted on the official blog thereafter (his announcement was subsequently deleted).
Rare Defiance
China is notorious for journalism censorship.
Most journalists in China, have no choice but to smile and put up with censorship throughout their career.
This incident has, however, enabled a rare open defiance against top-down censorship and even called for collective support from public intellectuals.
The rare defiance not only reflects the credibility and visibility of Southern Weekend to the public but also highlights the new power dynamics between the government and the public under the influence of new media.
As a visible figure on Sina Microblog, @五岳散人 wrote:
@五岳散人: Obviously, the incident infuriated the public and the whole incident is only going to intensify.
If the government cannot solve the root problem, it will eventually set itself on fire.
The government, instead of blocking the public voice, should let the voice go.
If censorship takes place, it means the government does wrong things and then they will be faced with queries regarding their governing problems.
In fact, writers, playwrights and directors are all under hostage when it comes to censorship in China.
Famous blogger and writer, Hanhan, depicts the real scenario artists face in China in his blog (he wrote the blog after two of his microblog accounts were deleted):
"while you enjoy so-called freedom, they enjoy freedom in punishing you.
It doesn't matter whether you work in literature, journalism, film or television, you have to go to exhausting lengths to get their permission.
There are no set rules to abide follow, so you end up more or less breaking their rules.
Essentially, you have to become one of them, and follow these rules.
Therefore, we censor our own work and our peers' work, as we try to understand what the rules are, we are careful and scared. "
Unlike the editorial staff at Southern Weekend, many others do not want to compromise their position and join the defiance.
The deputy editor-in-chief of People magazine wrote on his microblog:
@林天宏: In all these years, we have become accustomed to the fact that our drafts will be killed and our voice will be censored.
We began to compromise and began to deceive ourselves.
We became familiar with those ambiguous boundaries and started self-censorship.
We cannot feel enthusiasm anymore.
We have walked too far to remember why we chose this career in the beginning.
Why should we support the editorial staff at Southern Weekend?
Just one sentence: life is short, how can we forget our initial determination ?
Macedonia's Highest Court Confirms Fine for Journalists Who Quoted Statements Alleging Corruption · Global Voices
Editor-in-chief of Fokus magazine Jadranka Kostova and journalist Vlado Apostolov coming out from court hearing in May 2013.
Video screen grab from A1on.mk.
Even though he’s now a former head of the Macedonian Secret Service, Sasho Mijalkov seems to still wield a big influence on the judicial system in the country, especially when his “honor and reputation” is question.
The Constitutional Court in Macedonia confirmed a fine of 8,300 euros levied against two journalists from independent magazine Fokus, Jadranka Kostova and Vlado Apostolov, for defamation or “violating the honor and reputation of the former head of the secret service” — who is also a cousin of the outgoing Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
This was the third time that Macedonian courts have confirmed the sentence for quoting a source who said Mijalkov was involved in corruption.
The first degree court set the fine for the journalists at the beginning 2014, the Appellate Court confirmed the ruling in September 2014 and the Constitutional Court refused the journalists’ appeal in November 2015.
Fokus magazine's front page featuring Sasho Mijalkov Photo: Fokus.mk
The Constitutional Court in its decision stated that the lower degree courts correctly found that there were no grounds for excluding the responsibility of Apostolov and Kostova.
The court then stated that the published stories did not contain information of public interest but had intention "to spread rumors, which seriously violated someone's honor and reputation”.
The journalists from Fokus magazine, however, claim that the stories were published in order to encourage debate on issues of public interest and that the stories’ content undoubtedly concerned matters of public interest.
Kostova, who is editor-in-chief of the magazine, had to pay 5,000 euros, and journalist Apostolov was fined 1,000 euros.
In addition, they both must cover the court expenses of 3,300 euros, which in total adds up to 8,300 euros.
The former head of the secret service, who resigned due to other corruption and misuse of power allegations made by the opposition, sued Fokus in January 2013.
Fokus published several stories with statements by Igor Ilievski, Macedonia's former ambassador to the Czech Republic, in which he accuses Mijalkov for corruption.
Although the journalists asked Mijalkov for his reply to the allegations, he refused to participate in an interview and then sued.
In October 2014, the Association of Journalists of Macedonia called on all journalists and citizens to show solidarity with Fokus journalists and help fundraise the amounts set by the courts for the investigative pieces they published.
Other civic organizations like the National Network against Homophobia and Transphobia of Macedonia organized a fundraising event in Skopje Old Town on October 14, 2014, to aid Fokus in covering the defamation fine and cover court costs.
Fokus magazine's front page after the initial fine for the journalists in 2014
The case was highlighted as an instance of media intimidation by UN Rapporteur for Freedom of Speech Frank La Rue in June 2013.
Individual journalists, the Association of Journalists of Macedonia, the Journalists’ Trade Union, Reporters without Borders, and other organizations interpreted the rulings as a clear warning to media, and many confirmed the “chilling effect” this has had over Macedonian journalists.
Nikola Mladenov, the publisher and editor of Fokus, was found dead in a car accident on 27 March 2013, under murky circumstances.
After the accident, Fokus daily and weekly magazine stopped publishing.
The weekly magazine resumed publication in July 2013.
Mladenov’s death was mentioned in the so-called “bombshells” — leaked wiretaps illegally recorded the by Secret Service run by Mijalkov — that the country's political opposition published during 2015.
That particular "bomb" revealed conversations among top Macedonian politicians, including former Minister of Interior Gordana Jankuloska, her deputy Ivo Koteski, and Prime Minister Gruevski's chief of cabinet Martin Protuger, indicating that officials interfered in the investigation and organized harassment of journalists mourning Mladenov's death.
As a consequence, opposition leader Zoran Zaev and the Association of Journalists of Macedonia issued demands for the investigation to be reopened.
Macedonian Activists Collect 10,000 Signatures for Legislative Change · Global Voices
Activists of the civic initiative AMAN continue to fight for a better energy legislation , despite pressure and infiltrations.
In November, "unknown persons" prevented them from talking to PM Gruevski at an "open meeting with citizens."
Currently, there's an ongoing signature-gathering campaign for the change of the law (the deadline is January 31, 2013), and AMAN has posted this announcement :
Even though the necessary 10,000 signatures have been collected, the initiative continues. still needs to solve some technical details about closing the procedure, so it would be in our favor if more citizens show support for this initiative through their signatures.
This would mean a lot on the day when we submit the petition to the Parliament of the Republic of Macedonia; it would mean that all those citizens directly request their representatives to vote for the changes in the Law on Energy: for the return of a cheaper daytime tariff, and for the abolition of the obligation for consumers who disconnected from central heating to pay any more remittances to the companies.
Arab World: Let the Iranians do Whatever they Want · Global Voices
Iran's presidential election and its aftermath have grabbed the headlines of blogs across the Arab world this week as bloggers from all walks to life react to the latest developments in the region.
Jordanian blogger Hareega asks the rest of the world to stand aside as Iranians sort out their internal affairs on their own:
They had elections, whether or not they were fair is something we don't know and I don't think anyone will have the ability to tell.
I hate Ahmadinajhad but I like democracy and when people vote, their opinion needs to be respected.
I hate it how the US's attitude towards every other country where if "our guy" wins the elections would have been fair and the people spoke up their mind, but when the "bad guy" wins the elections are unjust.
Let Iranians vote for whoever they want to, and if they're taking the streets and are going bring down Ahmadinajhad let them do it themselves.
The last time the bad guy was brought down by a criminal military invasion things did not go very well and it was a country a little bit close to Iran both geographically and alphabetically.
At Arab-American joint blog KABOBfest, Kalash discusses the role the US plays in Iranian elections and sentiments on the street:
Whether or not Mousavi had the election stolen from him, it seems clear the ruling class has made a calculating move.
Anti-American sentiment is one of the strongest cards those wretched clerics hold.
By merely softening the tone Tehran hears from Washington, Obama has weakened their hand considerably.
But re-instating Ahmadinejad ensures that US-Iranian relations will continue down a rocky road.
What happens next is crucial.
If Obama takes a firm position as a result of what’s happening, the mullahs may emerge victorious.
That would be a real shame.
The system of governance in Iran is terrible.
There is no democracy to speak of.
The people are ruled by despotic men of ‘faith’ who do nothing to advance their country’s interests.
Aside from keeping Iran in the headlines, Ahmadinejad has done nothing to improve his country’s standing in the international community.
It should come as no surprise that so many Iranians are opposed to him.
It’s tempting to say that US officials have learned from past mistakes, but they could be helping to incite protests now just as they did back in 1953.
Hopefully what is happening right now is a homegrown phenomenon.
Iran needs another revolution if it is to rid itself of the backwards theology pulling the strings.
Mousavi is hardly the right person to lead such a movement, but what’s important is that the people rise up.
The process won’t be easy.
We may be witnessing the beginning of something huge… It won’t happen overnight, but the “Islamic Republic” is bound to fall one day or another.
Pro-Palestinian Jews Sans Frontieres writes:
I don't know what is going on in Iran.
The liberal bull#*it about the supposedly pro-Western reformist Moussavi supposedly pulling an upset victory over the supposedly retrograde Ahmedinejad doesn't make much sense.
On the people of Iran, the blogger says:
These people show courage facing an armed and willing to kill repressive state apparatus and they are making history.
They are blessed.
From Egypt, Wael Nawara at Weekite comments on US President Barack Obama's reaction to the Iranian elections saying: We have to admit that his comment is balanced and contains huge respect for the Iranian people and their aspiring experience.
At the same time, Obama's language is strong and clear, in supporting the universal rights for every human being and nation, and for Iranians to select who will rule them.
His speech also carries a positive spirit and hope, despite the evident concern regarding the violence.
And finally Irish for Palestine notes:
The Western media is pushing this idea that all the unrest we are seeing in Iran is because people want to overthrow the Islamic Republic, which I think is a dangerous thing to be pushing, but hey, the media have an agenda.
Fisk agrees and says this is not about overthrowing an Islamic state, they just want get rid of Ahmadinejad and have faith in the voting process.
The Best and Worst of Russia's New Year's Laws · Global Voices
Russian President Vladimir Putin addresses the State Duma in 2012.
Source: Mitya Aleshkovsky, Flickr.
Every year, the Russian State Duma schedules laws to come into effect on January 1.
In 2017, as ever, some of these laws seem poised to make positive contributions to Russian society and some...don't.
This year, RuNet Echo marks the highlights and lowlights—from a law that will bring Russian court records online to the introduction of forced labor in some state correctional facilities.
Тhe 'Google Tax'
Beginning on January 1, certain foreign Internet retail companies will have to start paying a value added tax in Russia.
Because the law affects companies that sell electronic books, music, movies, and computer programs, the legislation already has a moniker: the Google tax.
Accordingly, Google has increased prices for Google Drive services and Google Play purchases by 18 percent.
Disability and HIV Registries
January 1 also marks the introduction of a federal registry for Russians who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
The Russian Ministry of Health says it is introducing the registry to better understand the characteristics—and extent—of the country’s HIV problem: more than 1.5 million people, or more than 1 percent of the Russian population, have been diagnosed with HIV or AIDS.
Earlier this year, Russian authorities announced that the Ural city of Yekaterinburg, Russia’s fourth-largest city, is facing an HIV epidemic.
More than 1.8 percent of the city’s 1.4 million residents are infected with the virus.
For now, inclusion on the registry is voluntary, though the list will provide the basis for the state’s provision of antiretroviral medication.
Starting on the first of the year, the Russian Pension Fund will also introduce a registry of people with disabilities.
Officials hope the registry will help people with disabilities find work and raise awareness about the benefits and programs to which people with disabilities are entitled.
Russia has one of the largest gaps between the employment rate among people with disabilities and the employment rate among people without disabilities of any country, according to a recent study conducted by the International Labor Organization (ILO).
More than 12 million Russians, or almost 9 percent of the country’s population, live with disabilities, including 620,000 children.
New Rules for News Aggregators
The New Year also brings a new set of rules for news aggregators in Russia.
Aggregators whose daily traffic exceeds 1 million views will be considered media outlets in the eyes of the Russian government, forcing them to verify the truth of the news stories they republish—a nearly impossible task that seems to give the government license to crack down on the most popular aggregators in the country, including Yandex, Mail.ru, Google, and Bing.
RuNet Echo extensively covered the introduction of this legislation and the government’s pressure (and backpedaling) on Google.
Forced Labor
As of the first of the year, Russian courts will be allowed to sentence defendants to forced labor in correctional centers around the country.
Four large correctional facilities were scheduled to be opened on January 1—in the Siberian region of Tyumen, the Tambov region (southeast of Moscow), Stavropol Krai (in the North Caucasus), and Primorsky Krai (in the Far East)—in addition to seven smaller facilities across the country.
The centers will not have the same degree of security as normal correctional facilities, and inmates will be allowed to leave if they get permission from administrators.
They will not, however, be able to choose or change their jobs.
After the law was introduced, Valery Maksimenko, the head of the Federal Penitentiary Service, said that forced labor would compare favorably with other kinds of punishment because convicts would not be isolated from society: “Forced labor in correctional centers, despite the name, can be compared to shift work for people who live in dormitories away from home.”
Maksimenko’s assurance, however, will do little to assuage those who already see echoes of the Gulag in existing forms of labor in Russian penal colonies.
Forced labor was included as a potential sanction in the Russian Criminal Code in 2011, but its introduction has been delayed multiple times since.
Bringing Courts Online
New Year's legislation will also bring Russian courts online—at least some of them.
Moscow City and District courts are now accepting statements, appeals, and all other document submissions in electronic form, and court records are now searchable by the name of the individual involved, statute, and a variety of other ways.
Only courts with the technical capacity to implement such a digitization will do so, however, meaning the vast majority of Russian courts won’t have websites like the Moscow court system, whose website is already up and running.
In all, the Moscow digitization project took two years to implement and develop, and cost $172.4 million, $50 million of which came from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
Increasing the Retirement Age for State Employees
Until the first of the year, the retirement age for Russian civil servants and municipal employees stood at 55 for women and 60 for men.
Starting on January 1, the government will incrementally increase the retirement age to 63 for women and 65 for men at a rate of half a year per year (the age will increase until 2032 for women and and until 2026 for men).
The government says the initiative is designed to keep qualified government employees in their jobs longer, and to reduce the strain of pensions on the federal budget.
Higher Excise Taxes on Alcohol and Cigarettes
Finally, beginning on the first of the year, Russian drinkers will have to pay higher excise taxes on beer, wine, champagne, cider, medovukha (a mead-like drink), and hard liquor.
The excise tax on foreign champagne will increase by 10 rubles to 36 rubles per liter, and on domestic sparkling wine by 1 ruble to 14 rubles per liter.
The tax rate on Russian wine will remain the same, while the tax on foreign wine will increase by 9 rubles to 18 rubles.
Excise taxes on cigarettes and e-cigarettes will also increase over the next three years.
Greece: Outcry over arms shipment to Israel · Global Voices
With the war raging in Gaza, news reports earlier this month about the routing of an extraordinarily large shipment of arms from the United States to Israel through the private Greek port of Astakos caused an uproar among Greek bloggers.
They used Twitter to investigate the matter and put pressure on the government to halt the transfer.
Delivery of the munitions was suspended, just as the Greek government was coming under fire from opposition parties, and Amnesty International was calling for an arms embargo.
At first, official sources contested the story from the international news agency Reuters on January 9.
But it was picked up by Twitter users and investigated after Indy.gr - an offshoot of the Indymedia Athens group - provided a translation of the article in Greek.
The idea to organize an embargo of the port was proposed and widely "re-tweeted":
itsomp: http://is.gd/f8Wa Can we organise an embargo of the port of Astakos?
Only the US and Israeli ships...
Some tweeted direct queries to the Greek foreign minister, whose web team is operating a Twitter account:
Macedonians Ask State News Agency to Stop Manipulations · Global Voices
An online initiative against media manipulations perpetrated by the state-owned Macedonian Information Agency (MIA) asks citizens to express their dissatisfaction by sending e-mails to the agency.
The action was spurred by the latest example of blatant spin, when a MIA correspondent distorted U.S. diplomat Philip Reeker's statement about the disappointment with the Balkan leaders, making it appear as if he referred to the Macedonian opposition.
Reeker repudiated this in a statement for the critical portal Libertas, clarifying that he alluded to leaders who are actually in power and are backsliding from democracy.
Libertas also claims the government and MIA declined to comment afterwards.
U.S. Bills Could Threaten the Global Internet · Global Voices
At Global Voices, we understand that we, collectively, are the Internet.
Our individual participation is what makes the Internet a global conversation of startling depth and variety, but this is possible only because of its open technical and legal structure.
Unfortunately, there are powerful corporate and government forces who would prefer to see the openness and accessibility of the web restricted.
They seek to deploy censorship and surveillance in the name of enforcing copyright, employing the very tools used to censor the Internet in authoritarian countries, such as China, Iran, and Syria.
Ignoring the warnings of citizens and technologists, United States lawmakers are considering two bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP Act (PIPA), that are a real and dangerous threat to the openness of the web everywhere in the world.
In response, the Global Voices community has decided to join websites such as Wikipedia, Reddit and BoingBoing in “going dark” and will black out the Global Voices Advocacy site for 12 hours on January 18, and display a banner on other Global Voices sites that provides more information about the proposed bills.
We are an international volunteer community dedicated to amplifying citizen media from around the world.
In the last six years, we’ve produced more than 75,000 posts that link to blogs and other citizen content for readers in over 20 languages.
Our content is free to use, and free to share.
We rely on the open Internet to carry out our mission, and on social media and citizen media websites that allow for simple publication and sharing of content.
Platforms like WordPress, Wikipedia, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr, Reddit, Tumblr, and many other online media production communities host content on which we base much of our work.
The passage of SOPA and PIPA by the United States Congress and Senate would force social media platforms and other web sites that host user-generated content to pro-actively monitor and censor users to prevent them from posting words or images that may violate copyrights.
It would raise the cost of participation on these sites for all users worldwide, and could force many social media projects to shut down, especially smaller websites and businesses.
We are concerned this law would will inflict broad damage on the work of digital activists living under repressive regimes, as well as restrict basic speech freedoms around the world.
Current copyright laws are occasionally misused in the U.S, and can result in de facto speech restrictions.
In countries with less independent judicial systems, abuse of copyright law to repress activism is both simple and frequent.
Global Voices contributors in many countries face increasingly aggressive surveillance and censorship.
Several are in prison or exile because of their online activities.
Passage of these bills will send a clear message that the US government believes it is acceptable to monitor and censor citizens to identify "infringing activity" which too often is equated with political and religious dissent.
Passage of SOPA and PIPA would also give the United States government a disproportionate amount of power to determine the course of the Internet.
The result will be a more dangerous world for bloggers and activists, and less free speech for all.
Even though the current version of SOPA was put indefinitely on hold this week, PIPA, the Senate version of the bill, is still alive.
And the issues and forces that are driving the passage of a law remain.
For this reason, Global Voices is joining the Internet blackout on January 18, 2012.
Recent Global Voices Advocacy posts on SOPA/PIPA: Trevor Tim, ”How PIPA and SOPA Violate White House Principles Supporting Free Speech and Innovation” Katitza Rodriguez, “SOPA undermines the U.S. in its negotiations for a free, open Internet” Weiping Li, “For Chinese Netizens, SOPA is Another Great Firewall” Yoo Eun Lee, “Stop Online Piracy Act: The Fight Continues”

All Algerians saluted the resistance movement of the Tunisian people who brought down the despot Zine El Abidine Ben Ali after 23 years of unchallenged rule.
In every discussion forum, blogs and Facebook, Algerians can no longer find the words to salute the courage of Tunisians who have revolutionized their country by pushing "their" president to flee the country.
The blogger R.Z, on the blog Mots de Tête has paid tribute to the Tunisian people for its grand mobilization.
In an article titled "Oil or freedom?
Tunisians have made the choice ... " (a provocative title in connection with the latest developments experienced by the riots in Algeria, whose government has successfully reduced the youth revolt to a story of increasing oil and sugar prices), R.Z wrote:
Macedonia: New Laws to Have an Adverse Impact on Cultural Heritage · Global Voices
New laws in Macedonia are set to have an adverse impact on the country's cultural heritage.
Vasilka Dimitrovska, author of the acclaimed blog Archaeological Diary, has reacted to the fast-track lawmaking from a professional perspective:
The state adopted the Draft-Law on Treatment of Illegally Constructed Objects , popularly known as the Law for Legalization of Illegal Constructions, which will probably deal the final blow to the cultural heritage in the Republic of Macedonia (RM).
It is common knowledge that most of archaeological sites remain in rural areas, but there are many in urban environments – in the midst of cities.
Most of these sites also house illegal buildings which forever destroyed the ancient towns underneath.
According to the Archaeological Map of RM (Volume 2, published by the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts in 1995), just on the territory of the city of Skopje there are over 150 registered archaeological sites.
These areas overlap with well-known tumors of illegal constructions in Volkovo, Zlokukjani, Pripor…
For instance, the villas of the rich elite in Zlokukjani have encroached well within the 40 hectares covering the remains of the ancient Roman town of Scupi, forever destroying the history that belongs to the citizens of Macedonia and the whole world.
I wanted to write a longer, more documented post about this, but there’s no point in delaying.
By legalizing illegal construction around or within the areas of archaeological sites, we will lose a large portion of the Macedonian cultural heritage. This includes some important ancient cities, such as Scupi, Heraclea , Lychnidos, etc.
This administration has invested enormous amounts of money in archaeological digs, which, however, failed to produce a single publication, even after all these years.
This current law on legalization of illegal construction will destroy the effects of all their investments in archeology.

As an archaeologist, Ms. Dimitrovska stated that she’s obliged to care about the entire cultural heritage, regardless of the time period of its making.
The first step, in her opinion, would be to update and implement the defunct Law on the Cultural Heritage.
A reader nicknamed Aleksandar commented on this post:
It is obvious that those who wrote the Law haven’t consulted anyone - an old and well-known problem in Macedonia.
The view from the Cabinet is somewhat limited... It is sad to say it, but the people did not stir about many other things that affect their lives more directly, so it will remain numb about this too.
And again we return to the problem of education, and et cetera, and round and round…
Global Voices recently covered complaints by another blogger, who objected to the construction of new state buildings over probable archeological sites in the center of the Macedonian capital.

To increase the cultural benefit, here’s a bit more information about the archaeological sites from Macedonia mentioned in this post, with links to appropriate Wikipedia articles: Scupi was the Roman precursor of the current capital of Skopje.
Founded as a military camp around 168 BC, it grew into a prosperous city, which was then destroyed in the earthquake of 518 AD.
The population moved several kilometers down the river and even used some of the old marble to construct the current “old town,” i.e. the Kale fortress, a site of this recent incident.
Some of the gravestones from its cemeteries can be seen in the center of Skopje near the City Museum, while the actual site is near the road to Kosovo, not open to visitors.
Heraclea Lyncestis is near Bitola, the second-largest city in the Republic of Macedonia.
Founded by King Phillip II of Macedon in the 4th century BC, this “City of Heracles in the land of the Lynx” still contains important Roman and early Byzantine remains, including the famous mosaics and theatre.
Several years ago, the government adorned its steps with several Roman sculptures from this site.
Lychnidos is the ancient Greek name of Ohrid.
This pristine and strategically important area has been continuously inhabited for several thousand years, and is well-known for its preserved architecture, icons and other treasures from the medieval and Ottoman periods.
New digs under this layer, made during the last two decades, also yielded artifacts from more ancient times, including an amphitheatre, which is again used for concerts; and graves of alleged Ancient Macedonian warriors/generals (golden masks & weaponry) and noblewomen (sophisticated jewelry).
South Asia: Celebrating the 7 Billionth Child · Global Voices
On the 31 October, 2011, the earth welcomed a newborn child named Oishi.
Her birth in the Bangladesh capital Dhaka carried a special message - she is the 7 billionth child of the world.
The Editor.net reports:
The 7 billionth child of the world is here in Dhaka.
The lucky parents of the child are Mohsin Hossain and Tonni Hossain.
They had hoped for a boy child as their third child.
And this 3rd child is the 7 billionth child (symbolic) of the world.
The beautiful girl child was born on 12:01 AM at the early hours in Azimpur Maternity and Child Care Hospital.
It is difficult to identify exactly which child is the 7 billionth one, so a symbolic celebration is happening around the world.
UNFPA selected Oishi to carry the honor in Bangladesh.
The website adds:
This birth was celebrated publicly - with cake and candles.
The hospital was crowded with people who gathered to catch a glimpse of the child.
Sponsored by the 7 billion action program, this program was a publicity event.
Posha Pakhi at group blog Somewhereinblog.net carried the news with a post titled "The 7 billionth child was born in Dhaka".
The post attracted many comments:
Journo opined :
Welcome the the 7 billionth child from Bangladesh.
Hope she will live as an enlightened person.
Mithapur wished the child and questioned the justification of selecting her and mentioned jokingly :
One question: How did they calculate that she is the 7 billionth
If the line would read -
The world's 7 billion (instead of billionth) children born in Dhaka It can happen one day, isn't it?
Atiq cannot tell the difference between 7 billion and 7 billion plus one:
I don't understand all the fuss between 7 billion and 7 billion plus one numbers.
Why so much discussion on this?
Everybody is born with a number everyday.
My prayers for every one of them.
Although the world cheers at Oishi's birth, it did not cheer her parents much.
Because Oishi is a girl child.
Her parents wanted a boy this time (the first two are girls).

Not only in Bangladesh, similar celebrations took place in many countries of the world.
In Sri Lanka UNFPA celebrated the birth of Muthumani, the girl child of Ishara Madushanka and Danushika Dilani Perera.
Similarly in India Plan International celebrated the birth of Nargis as the 7 billionth child of the world.
LiveIndia.Com reports :
In Lucknow, the capital of Uttarpradesh state in India, a baby girl named Nargis was the symbolic seven billionth child to be born during the early ours of Monday.
She was named as Nargis.
Although the growing number of world population has been seen as a wake up call for the world, Muthumani, Oishi and Nargis give us the message that the girl-children should not be neglected in the future.
Egypt: January 25 Protests in Videos · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Protests 2011. Demonstrators took to the streets of Cairo and many other Egyptian cities on Tuesday, January 25 which coincides with a national holiday, "Police Day", to protest against the 30-year autocratic rule of President Muhammad Hosni Mubarak.
Emulating the Tunisian protests that led to the toppling of now-former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali a couple of weeks ago, protesters used social networks like Facebook and Twitter to coordinate their actions.
Tonight, news networks speak of tens of thousands of Egyptians camped in the main Cairo plaza, El-Tahrir Square, and demonstrations are set to continue Wednesday.
Many observers noted the lack of coverage of the protests by mainstream news networks.
Aljazeera's coverage in particular was remarkably sparse.
Citizen journalists have been feeding netizens with loads of videos from inside the demonstration.
Very Civilized and protected by the Egyptian Police Forces.
Late at night, news arrived of violent clashes between riot police and protesters who refuse to leave El-Tahrir square. This post is part of our special coverage of Egypt Protests 2011.
Take Back the Tech to Eliminate Violence Against Women · Global Voices
The collaborative global campaign Take Back the Tech! started on November 25, the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.
New information technologies are being used in many ways against women and girls around the world.
It is fundamental that they become tools of change and transformation, rather than control and exclusion.
This is one of the very objectives of the Take Back the Tech! campaign.
Take Back the Tech! (on Twitter @takebackthetech, using #takebackthetech) will have daily action campaigns during the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence (November 25 – December 10 each year).
This year it is focused on developing actions that defend women's right to freedom and expression and information.
Women and men in more than 30 countries have used information technologies such as the internet, mobile phones, and radio to document and fight violence against women since the campaign was developed by the Association of Progressive Communications Women's Networking Support Program (APC WNSP) in 2006.
On behalf of Global Voices, I interviewed Erika Smith, the APC WNSP communications coordinator, on issues regarding the campaign, violence against women, gender and technology, and the intersections of the global and the local.
Global Voices (GV)- What is the objective of the Take Back the Tech! campaign?
Erika Smith (ES)- The Take Back the Tech! campaign aims to eliminate violence against women (VAW) by using any technology within our reach to document, denounce and transform the reality of violence women face in every corner of the world - violence that is also now, increasingly, in online spaces or perpetrated using information and communication technologies (ICTs).
This year the campaign focuses on defending women's rights to freedom of expression and access to information - essential rights in order to be safe online and off, find support, and mobilise against violence.
The campaign's daily actions for every one of the 16 days from 25 November to 10 December deepen our understandings of VAW and the interconnections with ICTs, and push us to experiment with technology in different ways.
The campaign calls on everyone - from everyday internet users to bloggers to geeks to social network fiends and sms-addicts to channel energies towards ending VAW, it connects online action with direct local actions.
GV- What is the importance of a having a global campaign directed to empowering women through the use of technology?
ES- Technology does not empower women, women empower themselves when they use and transform technology to respond to their needs.
Many women have grown up in societies where technology is presented as out of their reach - gender stereotypes, access and affordability have meant that many women see technology as something that is "not for them".
Questioning that stereotype and demystifying technology in such settings breaks down assumptions made about women and that women make about themselves, too.
In the APC WNSP (APC Women) we've found that women and technology are a powerful mix for social change where the potential for women's empowerment is impressive.
Just taking the time out to examine the possibilities for information and communication technologies at the service of women's needs and rights has been eye-opening for many women - be they techies or with limited experience in ICT.
Violence against women is so often seen and experienced as a private, personal, intimate very local problem and as such invisibilised.
Yet it is a global pandemic, a threat to world public health and security, that women have tirelessly mobilised against for decades - locally and globally.
November 25 for many is a day of paralysing images and statistics, and the 16 Day campaign came out of feminists' insistence on keeping the spotlight on VAW and demanding real solutions.
Take Back the Tech! accompanies the 16 Days of Activism against Gender Violence to help grow the movement, increasingly interconnect actions, and build awareness about how technology is also transforming the way women can experience violence and mobilise against it.
GV- What are some of the relationships of gender and technology?
ES- I already mentioned gender stereotypes about women and technology above, especially acute for older women who did not grow up in the computer age.
But even with these stereotypes breaking down due to increased access and presence of ICTs in so many spheres of our lives (and too the current popularity of geekiness) women are still seen as consumers and users of technology and in the labour market are concentrated in the data-capture and call centre service provision of ICT work.
Hardware and software developers are predominantly male.
ICT developments are permeating our lives on so many fronts - from our moments of intimacy to the way we interact with our governments.
We seldom take time out to reflect on these changes from a gender and social change perspective, and question the implications.
How do you sanction violence against women online?
How much real harm is there in virtual cyberstalking?
What happens behind the code?
Who makes decisions and finances infrastructure? Why are certain developments benefiting big enterprise prioritised and social access needs ignored?
Cybercrime conventions seem to emphasise piracy more than trafficking of women.
GV- How does Take Back the Tech connect the local with the global?
ES- There are local campaigners in over 30 countries who may participate in the Campaign's daily actions on a personal or collective level, or they might do something entirely different directly in their communities to put the spotlight on VAW and ICT.
Some campaigners have organised trainings so that women can use ICTs to mobilise and express themselves for example learning how to build blogs in Montevideo, explore video and audio production for digital storytelling in Brazil, or create posters learning how to use graphics software in Argentina.
Others go out on the streets, for example in Johannesburg interviewing people about VAW, documenting abuse or protesting to demand solutions.
In the Congo girls made information CDs about violence against women and how to find help, and shared them at beauty salons around their communities, sparking debate amongst the women stylists and customers.
In Quebec, campaigners held a discussion raising awareness about violence in popular video games.
Romania: "A Tsunami" of Protests Against Austerity Cuts and Corruption · Global Voices
After five days of protests in Romania, representatives of the Romanian police are assessing the resulting material damage, the number of weapons confiscated and people held in custody at police stations.
The Romanian on-line community is trying to explain why people have taken to the streets, what the authorities' response was and what the outcome of the protests might be.
15, journalist Radu Tudor compared the protests to "a tsunami" sweeping everything in its path:
Thousands of protesters in Bucharest, Brasov, Timisoara, Pitesti, Deva, Sibiu, Iasi, Cluj Napoca and other important Romanian cities have demanded loudly and clearly: the resignation of Boc Cabinet and of President Basescu.
A democratic and relatively honorable resolution to this huge tension between the ruling authorities and the dissenting people are early elections.
In the minds of the majority, the decision has already been taken: the Basescu-Boc regime must end.
This has caused desperate diversions with “hooligans” meant to partially compromise the legitimacy of the protests and to discourage people from taking to the streets.
The violent rupture between the current rulers and the population can only have one verdict.
A tsunami in favor of political change has already started, coming from ordinary citizens.
It sweeps everything in its path.
Especially, at the top.

Political scientist Alina Mungiu-Pippidi wrote this on Romania Curata, an anti-corruption portal:
It was already time for protests.
But when collective action is spontaneous, without leaders and planning, we run the risk of seeing again what happened with the Revolution – the legitimate protest being stolen, twisted and used and others taking advantage of it without actually changing anything of substance.
Traian Basescu deserves what is happening.
Going outside the constitutional framework in order to hit a man who had already succeeded in implementing a reform – Raed Arafat – in the name of a future reform that even the World Bank, IMF and Romanian experts had doubts about, showing the same infallibility syndrome that reminds us of Ceausescu, he dropped the only guard that can protect a head of state.
And that guard is the law and the rightfulness given to you by goodwill.
No one is infallible, anyone can make mistakes, but at least you must be able to prove your goodwill.
After this week, the civil society has gone into clear opposition and its strength and territorial expansion have suddenly grown.
The question is how we could institutionalize such an opposition and use it in order to have fair elections , and after the elections to use it for controlling those in power. Day 4 of the rallies against austerity cuts and falling living standards. Bucharest, Romania.

Journalist Radu Lungu answers the question many are asking these days - “Why have we taken to the streets?":
Because what is happening in our society is our business.
Because we really felt we were not living in a free country anymore.
As all young people from our generation, who either remember very little from the communist days or were not even born yet, we too were manipulated by the media and political class.
We were told that what is happening in the society we live in is none of our business, that educated people do not mix with the commoners.
That we do not have their problems, that in our country nothing is done right and that that’s just the state of things.
That standing up against this state of things is the same as being immature, uneducated.
That we are going to leave abroad anyway and we’ll be rid of this impossible country.
We wanted to see with our own eyes what was going on, so we went into the streets with our cameras – unfortunately, we didn’t take our running shoes too, but you pick up the revolutionary fashion as you go along.
Radu Lungu recounts what he saw and lived through in the streets of downtown Bucharest:
At one point, the protesters stepped out into the road.
Gendarmes formed a line and closed the group of people in, pushing them back onto the sidewalk.
Many people coming back from a night out in the Old Town or standing in front of kiosks in the area were just caught in the middle and held by gendarmes.
There was somebody holding some cheese in a bag, trying to explain to the police that he had bought it for himself and not in order to use it for violent purposes.
People wanted to show their IDs to the gendarmes, but they refused to grant them this right.
People were also detained under the pretext that “now they can no longer leave” without being given any explanation.
People were constantly asking to be searched and identified on the spot, according to Law 550 of the Criminal Code.
Unfortunately, the crowd and the gendarmes could settle this legislative dispute only at police stations.
Still, the police at the station never had an aggressive tone.
Many gendarmes just told us we were in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Better to stay calm, sign some papers, take some photos and then off we went back home.
I want to end my reporting with an appeal to calm and nonviolence.
Personally, I will try to get as many people to come with copies of Laws 550 and 60 to hand to gendarmes on University Square. First, I thought of bringing copies of the entire Criminal Code, but then if we had the money for such intellectual accessories we would probably not take to the streets anymore.
17, following President Basescu’s requests, Raed Arafat returned to his position of deputy secretary of state at the Health Ministry and coordinator of the emergency medical system.
Journalist Radu Tudor sees this gesture as the “official recognition that Basescu can be defeated":
After having publicly humiliated Raed Arafat and having forced him to leave, on this day the infallible Basescu has died politically.
But the huge wave of popular discontent is already in motion.
Basescu is scared that is taking control of this discontent and this is actually the stake of Raed Arafat’s reinstatement.
Neither respect for him, nor recognition of his value, but the fear that the opposition will benefit from the national outrage shown over the last few days in tens of Romanian cities.
Raed Arafat’s reinstatement does not reinstate cut salaries, jobs, does not put a stop to prices going up, does not decrease VAT, does not rid millions of miserable people from huge worries created by this political regime.
Raed Afarat’s reinstatement is the victory of the idea that Basescu and his gang can be defeated.
'The Day I Became Just a Stupid Number': One Syrian Refugee's Journey to Europe · Global Voices
Zozan Khaled Musa
A lot has been written about refugees in the last two years.
But rarely do we hear from the refugees themselves in more than just soundbites.
GlobalPost, an international news organization within the PRI family, commissioned essays from five young Syrians who all made the difficult decision to leave their homes — and undertake a menacing journey out of the country, to Turkey, to Greece and across southern Europe.
This essay by Zozan Khaled Musa, 25, was originally published on PRI.org on May 31, 2016, and is republished here with permission.
After a long dark journey in the Aegean Sea, I arrived to the small Greek island of Nera at about 3:30 on the cold morning of Oct. 3, 2015.
There were many local fishermen who helped us after the boat landed.
They wanted to have the boat’s engine, which was valuable to them.
It was an unbelievable relief to see our feet on land again.
We decided to rest in a small room near the beach.
There was not enough room for all of us.
So only the women and children stayed inside.
I made my bag a pillow and my jacket a blanket, but it was so cold that I couldn't close my eyes.
When there was enough light, we walked to the local police station.
It was about two-and-a-half miles away.
Many boats arrived to the island that night.
Hundreds of people were standing in a line waiting their turn to be registered so they could take another boat to the main island of Kos.
In Nera, when my turn came to get inside the office, they wrote the number “17” on my hand.
I will never forget the day that I became just a stupid number on a long inhuman list.
How shameful for humanity that so many people became nonhuman in that single helpless moment.
I did all the procedures as best I could and headed to Kos, where the authorities waited for us with a paper with each one of our names on it.
That paper allowed us to get on a ship going to Athens.
It was a 12-hour journey.
I made it to Athens the next morning and parted from my husband's friend’s family and met a Greek friend who was helping me get on a bus to the Macedonian border.
It was 11 p.m.
"In Nera, when my turn came to get inside the office, they wrote the number '17' on my hand.
I will never forget the day that I became just a stupid number on a long inhuman list."
I arrived at the border at 6 a.m.
I had a small argument with a security guard at the border because he was not being fair.
Some people had been waiting for a long time, but he was letting the new ones in before them.
“You seem nervous.
If you want, you can go back to your country and stay there,” he told me.
I would not have kept silent, but a friend calmed me down.
Being a refugee or a war victim doesn't mean I have to shut up when I am treated badly.
I fled Syria not to have Europe's money or financial benefits.
I fled because the whole world became suddenly and intentionally blind, deaf and mute toward our human made disaster in Syria.
We paid 25 euros ($27) each to board an old trash pile they called a train.
No words can describe its dirt and terrible smell.
Then, when everyone was piled in, it moved as if walking on eggs.
That’s what we say in Syria about slow things.
But finally I was on the Serbian border.
It was then that I began to wish I never had started this journey.
I had the worst experience after walking a long way, about four miles, to the first town where the registration center was.
I can't remember the name of the town.
I was so tired.
But I wish I knew it so I could tell the world how bad it was there.
It was supposed to be a place for people to have some rest.
But refugees were out in the streets and were allowed only to get in for a few minutes to put their details on papers and to become a number again.
It was a shock to see thousands of people waiting and pushing each other, and how badly everyone was being treated by the Serbian police.
It is an experience you would never want to go through unless you are truly desperate.
Some people I met there said they had been sleeping in the street for days while waiting for that silly registration paper.
Nothing in such a journey is rational or human.
After the hopeless waiting, I got to know a Serbian journalist.
She was a nice lady and she helped me get in faster.
She even managed to help me get permission to take the bus to Croatia for a few hours so I could see a completely different place, where people behaved differently.
I saw real humans with real compassion.
They were amazingly respectable people.
I was given some hot tea and some rest.
That same day I took the train to Hungary.
On that train, I finally got some sleep.
In Hungary, I didn't see anything since I arrived at night and immediately got on the train.
But I did see the new fences on its borders with Croatia, which would be closed only a week after my arrival in Germany.
Another door closed in the faces of refugees.
In a few hours I was in Vienna, Austria.
I spent a night in a sports complex that had been turned into a place for refugees.
That night I slept as if I had never slept before, although it was an open place where all people there can see you.
In the morning I went to the main train station and booked a ticket to Germany.
I was so afraid that I would be caught in Passau, the town in Germany that is on the Austrian border.
I wanted so badly to see my husband, who was already in Germany.
On the way I didn't speak a single Arabic word so that no one would know that I was a refugee.
I met some Americans on the train.
They were tourists.
I had a small chat with them about their trip.
We also talked about the refugees.
The woman was not happy with them at all.
They both didn't know that I was myself a refugee until we arrived at the border.
I saw the German police waiting to get on the train.
I pretended to be sleeping.
But I could hear what was going on.
I closed my eyes for about a half an hour, a moment that felt endless.
Migrants and refugees were caught and brought out of the train.
As for me, maybe my ability to speak some English and the fact that I don’t wear a hijab — most of the other women were wearing it — helped me not be spotted.
After the train doors closed, I sighed in relief.
I opened my eyes from my fake sleep to see from the windows hundreds of children, women and men — old and young — standing in a row with the police surrounding them.
That was my first experience in Germany.
I was happy that I could pass safely but it was not nice to see those helpless people out there as if they were criminals, especially those who were not wanting to stay in Germany.
I put myself in their shoes.
It's hurtful when you see others look at you in a certain way, assuming that you came because of poverty.
That's what most people think of the word “refugee.”
Zozan is Yilmaz's wife.
She is now living in a tiny town of about 5,000 people in northern Germany, close to the Netherlands.
She recently was scheduled to have an interview with the immigration office.
Then she will have to wait for approval to get her three-year residency visa. Then she will be able to move to Berlin, where she will reunite with Yilmaz.

Java Jive writes about the flooding in Jakarta:
“While December was quite sunny and pleasant, the New Year has brought angry torrential downpours, massive cracks of frequent lightening, and of course, annual flooding.
“As I write this post, I’m overlooking a wide canal fully loaded with rainwater and debris.
The sky is clouding up, and opening like a wound, while menacing storms are once again forecast for the remainder of this week.
One solid night of rain and we won’t be able to get out of Kelapa Gading since the road that leads to the toll is amongst the lowest and quickest to flood.
“Am I nervous?
Not at all.
“But I am nervous for those families who cannot get out.
For those with small children who cannot get clean drinking water or medical attention.
For those who have risked (or not trusted) not having insurance on their homes, businesses, and cars.
And for those who may lose everything yet again.”
Mywebsiteku expects flooding to continue until next month:
“Peak of the rainy season is in progress at this time is estimated to occur in February 2009.
This is a potential trigger the occurrence of disasters such as soil movement (landslides), flood, wind and waterspout.
This is seen from the growth of cloud in Jakarta and surrounding areas of improvement so that the intensity of rainfall affect. therefore need to alert the public on the weather conditions at this time.”

Lebanon: Protest in Support of Egypt · Global Voices
A solidarity protest in support of the demonstrators in Egypt is taking place next to the Egyptian Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon.
Similar protests are being reported around the world, as Egyptians continue to rally against the 30-year rule of president Hosni Mubarak.
Twitter user Angie Nassar shares her observations in a series of tweets, with photographs.
About 150 to 200 supporters turned up at the event, which is being closely monitored by the Lebanese security forces.
The protesters are seen waving both Egyptian and Tunisian flags.
Angie tweets:

China: Not Worried About Twitter's Decision to Self-Censor · Global Voices
Twitter's announcement Thursday that the site will begin censoring content according to the relevant laws, regulations and policies of each country in which it has users, was followed not only by American netizens, but discussed as far away as China.
Although Twitter remains blocked in China, the site's Chinese-language users, an assorted bunch, moved quickly to source people to translate the company's statement and figure out what it might mean—a Twitter.cn, for example, or, as Ai Weiwei wonders, if the time has come to move on in search of a new platform with more respect for its users .
Wen Yunchao, a well-known Internet activist from Guangzhou now working in a sort of domestic exile in Hong Kong as a producer for a new TV station, posted his thoughts on Twitter's new censorship measures to his Twitter account (@wenyunchao) several hours ago: Image from Weibo
Recently, it has been reported that an arranged marriage between a 14-year-old girl and a 23-year-old teacher ‘has triggered a call for a fresh debate on child marriage’.
Under Malaysia’s Syariah Law, which has jurisdiction over Muslims, Muslims under the age of 16 would require the consent of the Syariah Court before a marriage is allowed.
In this case, the Court had granted permission for the couple to marry.
Glenda Larke believes that a child marriage is no different to paedophilia, even if it is legal.
A 14-year-old school girl is not an adult.
She's not a woman, even if she has started her menses.
She's still a child.
She looks up to adults.
Her religion and her culture tell her to obey her elders, especially her parents.
She is gullible and vulnerable.
A 23 year old man who marries her - an educated man, not some illiterate fellow whose society is still steeped in the 19th century idea that children should be working at 12 and married at 14 - is purely and simply a paedophile.
B.Joe is of the opinion that the rights of children and minors are not being upheld by the Syariah Court and the girl’s parents.
And the funny part of the whole deal is that the marriage was approved by the Syariah Court – what happened to the protection of the minor?
Why the parents could not wait for a few more years until the minor is able to decisions for herself?
Un:dhimmi also believes that it is morally wrong.
Study after study shows that girls subjected to sexual activity at such early ages suffer not only damage to their still-developing reproductive systems, but also lasting psychological trauma.
However, Fyzal took a more neutral stance on the issue.
In the situation above the consent of Syariah Court has been obtained.
That means we should have confidence in our Syariah Judges - they must have taken into account all circumstances before granting consent.
Such consent, I believe, had been granted on the confidence of the judges that the man can take care of the girl and the girl could grow up well under the care of that man.
If the judge doubted it, such consent will not be granted.
Thus, I submit that in the issue of the marriage of Muslim girls under the age of 16, lets the Syariah Courts do their work.
They know when to grant the consent and when not to grant the consent.
But I am of the view that open discussion is still required between the Government and the Syariah experts to deal with this issue.

Egypt: "We are No Longer Afraid" · Global Voices
It's past midnight in Cairo, Egypt, where anti-Mubarak demonstrations continued for the sixth day.
As the protests grow stronger, so does the will of the people to oust president Hosni Mubarak, who has been in power for 30 years.
On Twitter, @shaistaAziz writes: "We've been afraid for 30 years - we are no longer afraid" and at the Cairo demonstration in Tahrir Square, a protester carries a placard with a simple solution: "Mubarak, You go away.
I go home.
The End."
The demonstrations started on January 25 and were coordinated following a call on Facebook, by the We are all Khaled Saeed group.
The group is named after Khaled Saeed, a young man from Alexandria murdered at the hands of police.
His death, last June, caused widespread demonstrations and rage against police torture and the ‘use of Emergency Law to terrorise citizens.”

Netherlands: Dutch-Iranian woman executed in Iran · Global Voices
Zahra Bahrami
According to Dutch and international news media, Dutch-Iranian Zahra Bahrami has been executed in Iran after having been found guilty of drug-related crimes and sentenced to death on 2 January.
She was arrested on 27 December 2009 when she reportedly attended an anti-government demonstration during a visit to Tehran.
The Campaign to Free Political Prisoners in Iran wrote a letter to the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in September 2010 urging them to make demands to Iran for her release.
Amnesty International's Dutch section also took up Bahrami's cause under strong suspicion that Bahrami never received a fair trial.
This morning, they reported the news of her execution on Twitter:
Away from the political scene and on a more human level, a short movie shot by young Saudi filmmaker Bader AlHomoud named "Almagbarah," which translates to cemetery in Arabic, has changed the life of a Saudi family.
Bader describes the montage phase in his tweet : Today I got depressed while editing a movie that will make you all depressed too
The three-minute movie, posted below from YouTube, shows a Saudi family living in a cemetery.
It has no script, nor a dialog.
It features members of the family and their children playing around the cemetery and the abject poverty they live in.
Saudi tweeps were emotionally touched by the movie and below are some of their reactions under the hashtag #ma8barah.
@MarwanAlrouqi describes the logic behind the location : Dear Saudi citizen, for your convince we picked you a residence that is far away from the noise and close to your resting place!
A screen shot from the movie
@hayaalshatti asks :
هل أصبحت خيارات الحياة تقف عند أنني يجب أن أفضح ملامحي وأنشر فقري في فلم .. حتى أحصل على كرامة .. تباً لمن سلبهم كرامتهم ! #ma8barah #KSA Did we reach the point in which I have to expose my life in order to get some dignity?
Woe to those who robbed them of their dignity!
And in reaction to the video, which has been watched more than 148,000 times on YouTube, smartman7779 says : This is sad, I cried watching it!
Thank God for my circumstances
Three hours after publishing the movie, Princess Ameerah Al-Taweel, who is Vice-Chairwoman of the Board of Trustees and Head of the Executive Committee of the Al-Waleed bin Talal Foundations, announced on her Twitter account:
الحمد لله، ستقوم مؤسسة الوليد بن طلال الخيرية بتأمين سكن دائم لهذه العائلة وتم التواصل مع بدر الحمود وسنبدأ من الغد إن شاء الله #ma8barah Al-Waleed bin Talal Charity Foundation will provide the family with a permanent residence, we are currently contacting Bader AlHomoud
@malsahli comments: If the creative Bader did not shed light on this family they would have been still living behind the skyscrapers and forgotten!
and @essamz stresses on the power of the social media:
فيلم مدته 3 دقائق يؤدي لحل مشكلة عائلة خلال 3 ساعات من نشره. إنها قوة الإعلام الجديد. #ma8barah A three minute movie solves a problem in three hours.. that is the power of the new media!
Two days later, @BaderAlHomoud announces: The family received a car from an anonymous donor
Balkans: Online Platform Tracks Reports From Areas Hit by Record Snowfall · Global Voices
Since last week, the Balkans have been hit by massive snow storms, the likes of which have not been seen in over a decade, if not longer.
After an unusually long period of nearly no real signs of a typical Balkan winter, last week brought what seems to be non-stop snowfall throughout the region, including the seaside areas around the Adriatic that seldom get any snow.
Men shoveling snow from a street in Sarajevo.
Record snowfall has paralyzed transportation in the Bosnian capital, where a state of emergency has now been declared.

In an article titled "Serbia Blocked by Snow, State of Emergency in 27 Municipalities, Recommendation to Call Off School Attendance" , the Head of the State of Emergency Sector of the Serbian Ministry of Internal Affairs, Predrag Maric, is reported to have stated on Friday:
27 municipalities in Serbia have declared a state of emergency due to heavy snowfall.
Maric has told Beta news agency that the most difficult situations are in Sjenica, Ivanjica, Prijepolje, Crna Trava and Surdulica, where the height of snow has reached approximately 2 meters.
According to him, power supply is "relatively good," outages are being fixed quickly and there have been no long power outages.
Maric also announced the possibility of declaring a full state of emergency nationwide, which the Government did on Sunday evening, cancelling school throughout Serbia at least until Friday, February 10, among other things.
Several actions have been organized by the online community in Serbia and the region to fend off the snow and to attempt to regain a functional state in urban areas at least, such as a #lopataup ("#shovelup"), organized by one online community leader, Zoran Torbica, and other local Twitter users.
In the meantime, Al Jazeera Balkans, the recently established regional office of Al Jazeera news network in the region, has joined forces with the team from Ushahidi to set up a platform for tracking verified information on everything from road blocks, power outages to other critical points and information in the entire region.
Ushahidi is an open-source platform for information collection, visualization and interactive mapping, which was also used in Serbia just after the earthquake in Kraljevo in November 2010 to map and track damage in the area.
Haris Alisic, who heads the New Media team for Al Jazeera Balkans, launched the platform on Sunday evening, and many members of the online community, including some of the region's GV authors, have joined the Al Jazeera-Ushahidi team in curating, tracking and verifying reports from the region.
The adapted Ushahidi platform can be located on Al Jazeera's official site, while reports can be sent in by anyone using the following channels:
- via SMS to +387644218661
- via Twitter by using the hashtags #kolaps #sneg #snijeg #lopataup #iskljucenje
- via email to oluja2012@aljazeera.net
- or by entering information directly into the form on the"pošaljite izvještaj" tab on the Al Jazeera page
If you would like to volunteer your time to help map critical areas and are familiar with using online tools, please contact the author of this article, or Haris Alisic via Twitter, or leave a comment here on Global Voices, and we will contact you for more information on what you can do to help.
We also ask that you all begin reporting from your area on Twitter and using the above-mentioned hashtags on Twitter, which are automatically collected by the platform and then reviewed and verified by Al Jazeera and volunteers.

Egypt: Dreaming of a Better Tomorrow · Global Voices
As demonstrations in Egypt enter their twelfth day, some are becoming discouraged, but still others have kept high hopes for a positive outcome.
Global Voices author Eman AbdElRahman is among the latter; on her blog, she shares her feelings on the continuing revolt, all started by a favorite song:
On 21st of February 2010, and after watching an interview with Dr. ElBaradei on Dream2 TV station, I posted a video for the song “Dream with me” by Hamza Namira..
That day I dreamed to see my country free.
Free from dictatorship, curroption, violance and humiliation.
I believed the dream so much that I dedicated all my wishes only to see the day when Egypt becomes the one I loved before seeing..
Eman continues:
Today, I saw again the same song with other photos, from the revolution.
Our revolution..
I was suddenly trembling and shivering.
I never told anybody before that I am still in disbelief..
Despite living it minute by minute, and second by second for the past 12 days, I can’t believe what is happening.
Sometimes I wake up and tell myself “I must have been dreaming”.
But it is not a dream anymore..
I have so much to say.
So much to write to behold the memory, but words stand so small in front of what I am experiencing now.
I just knew how deeply I love Egypt, more than I thought I really do..
The video, as well as her blog post, have caught on on Twitter, with others sharing their thoughts.
@msheshtawy, sharing the video, writes:
I dream of a better Tomorrow, Masr bokra a7la http://youtu.be/zHZbZm69PCE #egypt #jan25
@ishtarmuz shares the video as well, tweeting:
Watch 'Dream With Me (Ehlam Ma'aya) - 25 Jan Revolution' #JAN25 You get the message without speaking the language. http://bit.ly/gNGqBZ
Dreaming of a better future for Egypt has become a theme on social media; another video speaks of dreams of revolution:
On Twitter, @randa610 shares her own dream for Egypt:
My Dream Egypt: where no one will compromise my life for more power or money. #jan25 #hopeisintheair
Saying goodnight, @pakinamamer thanks the world's supporters of her country:
With all those beautiful friends and strangers supporting us & praying for our safety, I'm sure I'll sleep well.
Goodnight <3 #Jan25 #Egypt

China: Several Tibetan Language Blog Sites Shut Down · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Languages and the Internet.
The blog section of the website AmdoTibet has been closed (the rest of the site is functioning) and the following notice can be seen:
The notice in Chinese reads: "Due to some of the blog users not publishing in accordance with the goal of this site, the blog has temporarily been shut down, we hope that blog users will have understanding!"
Another very popular blog site Sangdhor.com is also offline, without any explanation.
In October 2011, Sangdhor boldly published a poem titled "Mourning" that was about the self-immolations in Tibet.
The poem was quickly taken offline.
An English translation of the poem was published on High Peaks Pure Earth.
Below are two screenshots of Sangdhor.com, the top screenshot shows Sangdhor in its functioning state and the bottom screenshot was taken earlier today:
Finally the blog site Rangdrol.net is also offline and contains an interesting notice in Tibetan.
In October 2011, Rangdrol published a poem titled "The Truth of Flames on the Thorny Path" which carried many references to fire and flames; the poem was taken offline (read the English translation on High Peaks Pure Earth).
Below is a screenshot of Rangdrol taken earlier, the English text "Site off-line" suggests that the administrators have removed the site, and the Tibetan text underneath reads: "For the sake of life, we are mourning and crying".

Egypt: Citizen Media Exposes Violence During Media Black Out (Graphic) · Global Voices
Warning: the videos listed bellow contain images that are graphic in nature.
Viewer discretion is advised.
On February the 2nd, the Egyptian authorities decided to restore the Internet after five days of a near-complete shut down of the service.
During that period, which is believed to have cost the country tens of millions of dollars, the government clamped down on journalists and international media, heavily disrupting cell phone communications and satellite broadcasting.
During the ban, activists succeeded in circumventing censorship and filtered out hours of videos, filling the gap created by the media black out.
The content of some of these videos has not been independently verified but they capture the violence that was occurring on the sidelines of the "revolution," away from the peaceful scenes of ordinary traffic in downtown Cairo and empty streets that the State TV has been broadcasting during the period of the ban.
Iran: Bloggers React to Rumors of Military Strikes · Global Voices
The rumor of an impending Israeli or American millitary attack on Iranian nuclear facilities has become a top news story.
Israeli officials have emphasised that the rumor could turn into reality, as United States media has reported that Iran is on brink of nuclear capability.
Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon has said that Israel is not bluffing in its threat to take military action against Iran's contentious nuclear program.
Russia, meanwhile, has called the threat a mistake.
Iranian civil society actors reacted to this disturbing news, as did bloggers.
Dodoozeh published several photos of toy weapons, and writes that the Revolutionary Guards are ready with new weapons to defend the Motherland.
Takeview published a photo of a pin-up model photo sitting on a bomb in a post titled "Wrong image of Iran’s war".
"The UK and U.S. are drawing up plans to attack Iran," writes the blogger, "amid growing tensions in the Middle East, it was claimed last night."
Nesvan recalls the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, and writes:
once upon in time there was war in Iran and we listened to red alert...the goods were rare in market but that time was different that now.
It was just one year after the revolution and people thought they overthrew Shah and then they can do anything.
It is like these people are not the same ones living in country.
Today again we listen to the war news but what the war will solve for us?
For western countries it can move their economic wheels, sell their weapons and gets rid of Iran's nuclear facilities.
They can make profit but what about us?
Do not you think that a limited attack to Iran, will make this regime prevail for years?
And Azar Tondar says:
there are signs that western countries aim to beef up pressure on Iran at the same time that attacking Iranian nuclear facilities makes the headlines: a UN resolution condemning human rights violation in Iran, an International Atomic Agency report on Iran suspected nulear activities and terrorist plot.
Egypt: Welcoming A New Country · Global Voices
Egyptians are dreaming of a better future, and for some the dream is already coming true.
In this post we hear from Egyptian bloggers who feel they are seeing a new country being born, the country they have been waiting for.
Mona Seif (@monasosh) has been giving regular updates from Tahrir Square, including on the night of 2 February.
She reacts to the descriptions of her being "brave":
I have to clarify this: I was not brave, I was protected.
The battle extended over the night.
It started with rocks & glass, moved onto Molotov cocktails, then there was gun fire.
The army was there motionless, and at one point they even all went down and hid in their trucks.
I could never find the words to describe the bravery I witnessed that night.
That night made me fully realize, the Egypt I really want is that of Tahrir square.
The people there are what Egypt is all about, and I am with them in whatever fate awaits us.
Revolution.

Merry describes visiting Tahrir Square with a friend, and the encounter they had with some protestors:
One of them asked me and my friend as his face beamed with a smile “why did you come?”… my friend said “because this is our country…”, I looked him in the eye and resisted hugging him as I answered “because YOU are my country”… and they are, Oh God, they are the country I have been looking for my entire life and I finally found it…
The sentiment is echoed by Nadia El-Awady on Twitter:
Egyptians at home: stop watching state tv and come to tahrir.
See the #Egypt we've all been longing for #jan25
The blogger who calls herself Fugitive in a World of Dreams writes: I chose for my blog the name “A World Out Of This World”, referring to it being a world of dreams...Nothing we were hoping for had been or would be achieved in it… A world in which I could swim around in my imagination, however far it might be, without reaching the nearest dream… But after 25 January I discovered that I had been greatly mistaken… Egyptian youth taught me – indeed the whole world taught me – that it is not impossible; you can dream and achieve your dream, however large it is.
All you need is the will to achieve what you are hoping for… I am proud that I am Egyptian and that I belong to this wonderful generation of Egyptian youth… Egypt has truly become a world out of this world, by every measure.
Egypt: Our Hero, Wael Ghonim · Global Voices
For days, Egyptians have been searching far and wide for Wael Ghonim, the Google executive who went missing on January 27.
Today, after much speculation, Ghonim was released.
Google itself was among the first to make the announcement on Twitter:
Huge relief-Wael Ghonim has been released.
Our love to him and his family.
In the few hours since his release, Ghonim has given two interviews.
The first, tweeted by @HabibH, is below, with a translated version available at Alive in Egypt:
The second, for DreamTV, was streamed live and live-tweeted by journalist Sultan Al Qassemi, who quickly translated the interview into English.
The following are a few of Ghonim's statements captured in the tweets:
Wael @Ghonim: They wanted details, information.
"Are the people who planned this outsiders?"
We didn't do anything wrong, this was an appeal
Wael @Ghonim: The Egyptian State TV channels didn't portray the truth, that is why people watch the private channels now
Al Qassemi concluded his tweeting with this statement:
Wael @Ghonim's last words: I want to tell families who lost their sons this is not our fault.
This is the fault of those clinging to power.
Egyptians and others on Twitter were captivated by Ghonim's interview, with many calling him a hero. @EgyptSecularist writes:
This is a turning point in the revolution. @Ghonim's emotions will give more determination to #tahrir.
Tomorrow is going to be tremendous.
@SarraMoneir also expresses her appreciation:
egypt is crying... i´m drowning in my own tears.
GOD BLESS YOU @Ghonim
@CaireneGirl Sherine Elbanhawy also gives Ghonim adulation:
@Ghonim We are so proud of you.No one blames you.
U are a true patriot.
We love u.
Hold your head up high.
You have liberated #Egypt #jan25
Cairo-based journalist Ben Wedeman (@bencnn) agrees:
the wael @ghonim interview on DreamTV: Earthshaking. #Jan25 #Egypt #tahrir Egyptian journalist @SarahCarr sees things the same way: The next time someone doubts the logic of the Tahrir occupation make him watch the @ghonim interview #jan25
Haiti: One Year Ago...We Remember · Global Voices
Today marks one year since the devastating earthquake struck Haiti.
Haitian bloggers are remembering...
The Livesay Haiti Weblog writes:
On 1/12/2010 at 4:53pm the landscape of Haiti was irrevocably changed.
Despite great tribulation and loss the heart and spirit of the people endures.
Today an entire country stops to remember those they lost.
Please pray for them and with them.
The blog also takes a look back at posts that were written soon after that fateful day, adding:
There is no week in our lives in 38 years that is as vivid and clear in our memories as a year ago this week.
It is so hard to imagine or accept the volume of suffering that occurred in the hours and days that followed the earthquake.

Karlito's Blog posts an image that "you possibily have been seeing this image pop up pretty much everywhere on social networks (Facebook, Twitter, BBm) today", explaining:
Late last night as I was thinking about a way to commemorate the one year anniversary of Haiti”s devastating earthquake, It came to mind that I didn’t need to do much, I just needed to be a survivor, so I created this little image symbolically.
We need to be there not only to tell a story, the story, our story as we remember it to our children and our grandchildren but also to help built a better and safer future for them.
We need to be survivors everyday so that every step we make forward in this life be the reflection of our gratitude for the blessings that God has bestowed upon us everyday since that day.
Nothing is greater then the gift of life.
The blog also posts the reflections of a member of the Haitian diaspora, here:
All these statuses were desperate but the one who really told me what happen was J'esus men on tremblement de terre touye tout moun nan peyim la.'
I WAS SHOCKED…..
I remember…
I screamed in the house and my aunt run out to check on me, after i told her the tragedy i don’t remember exactly the order of the things that happened but i remember trying to call my parents in Haiti with no answer and i know we turn on the tv and i am sure that’s where i saw Carel broadcasting about what happened with tears in his eyes, listening to his desperate voice was painful…
I remember… 2 weeks ago , i went home to see what was left of my hometown but also for the holidays that weren’t holy nor happy.
With the few Ms earthquake left for Haiti, we Haitians couldn’t celebrate.
What i saw in my brothers eyes while i was going through Port-au-Prince was a mixture of despair, fear, suffering , misery, pain, hate, indifference but mostly the waiting of better days to come…. A year after there is still a lot of rubble, people are still living under tents in these refugees/victims camps, people are still steeling,women are still being raped, violence is not stopping and cholera is still making victims…. maybe its because i am an outsider that i didn’t realise any changes were made , but if i am comparing to the pictures i have received a year ago ta what i saw, besides the dead bodies and a few rubbles removed , the rest is the same……THE BIG WORK HASN’T BEEN DONE….

Bloggers on the ground in Haiti continue to weigh in.
The Apparent Project Blog writes:
The last few days have been hard.
Somehow I wish the calendar wasn't cyclical, because I'm not really ready to remember what happened a year ago.
A lady stopped by yesterday.
I didn't recognize her until she showed me a mangled scar on her ankle.
She thanked me that she still had her foot.
I remember now.
She was the woman that Jocelyn and I carried up a hill, over a rooftop that had crumbled and had taken care of in my yard for almost a week, cleaning and dressing her wounds until help arrived.
There were so many that I think about, wonder how they are doing, wonder what kind of emotional scars they carry around with them.
I spent yesterday trying to figure out what I was going to do today.
I heard that they resurrected the Iron Market and it opened yesterday.
I used to go there for all of my beads when our jewelry program had just started.
It was a place of significance for me and I cried as I saw the beautiful historical marketplace crumpled on the ground in the wake of the quake.
I think for me it will be a moment of joy to see it rebuilt.
The one thing that is fixed.
The one thing that has been restored and repaired.
Indeed, @RAMHaiti posted several tweets about the inauguration of the rebuilt Iron Market:
WOW!!!
The New Iron Market!!
Thank you Denis O'Brien and #Digicel http://twitpic.com/3p5nau

Today, whether it was through tweets, poetry or suggestions about ways in which to move forward, there is no doubt that this sad anniversary was top of mind in the regional blogosphere.
Perhaps Shelley Clay sums it up best - today is important to remember because it is about the Haitian people:
It is January 12th.
A baby is coming into the world today.
A country is on her knees today.
I will spend my day waiting for news of a boy or girl, probably go down to see the beautiful Iron Market, probably cry a little, hug my kids a lot, and remember what happened one year ago.
God Bless Haiti this year!

Egypt: "I am writing for the sake of history" · Global Voices
The protests in Egypt continue, and have the attention of people not only in Egypt, but across the region and around the world.
In this post we hear from a blogger who wants to remind anyone who might sympathise with President Mubarak just how things have reached this point.
Rehab Waliuddin is a translator in Cairo, and blogs at The Bird Looking From The Window. She has written a post called "I am writing for the sake of history": أكتب للتاريخ كي يدرس ابناؤنا ثورة 2011
أكتب للتاريخ كي تقرأه أم كل شهيد قدمت ولدها فداءً للوطن
أكتب للتاريخ كي يعرف العالم كم كان المصريون أبطال
أكتب للتاريخ كي يرى الناس كيف ينصر الله الحق ولو بعد حين
أكتب للتاريخ كي يعلم الناس كيف يتم تضليلهم عبر وسائل الإعلام
أكتب للتاريخ لأسطر بها ولادة بلد كانت وستكون قائدة الأمة وأم بلاد الشرق
أكتب للتاريخ كي أسجل تاريخ ولادة مصر الحرة
أكتب للتاريخ ليعلم أبناؤنا كم ضحى آباؤهم وأمهاتهم من أجلهم
أكتب للتاريخ كي ننصب يوم الثلاثاء عيدًا لشهداء ثورة 2011
أكتب للتاريخ لنتذكر خالد سعيد ومن سبقوه وتبعوه من شهداء للتعذيب أو للثورة
أكتب للتاريخ لنتذكر بو عزيزي فتيل الثورة التونسية التي كانت أول الغيث وبداية الأمل I am writing for the sake of history, so it will be read by my children and my brothers’ and sisters’ children and the next generation
I am writing for the sake of history, to teach our children about the revolution of 2011
I am writing for the sake of history, so it will be read by the mother of every martyr sacrificed for the nation
I am writing for the sake of history, so the world will know how many Egyptians were heroes
I am writing for the sake of history, so people will see how God makes truth victorious in the end
I am writing for the sake of history, so people will know how they were misled by the media
I am writing for the sake of history, to record the birth of a country that was and will be a leader of nations and mother of the countries of the East
I am writing for the sake of history, to record the story of the birth of free Egypt
I am writing for the sake of history, to teach our children how much their mothers and fathers sacrificed for them
I am writing for the sake of history, so we establish Tuesday as a holiday commemorating the martyrs of the revolution of 2011
I am writing for the sake of history, so we remember Khaled Saeed, and those before and after him who have been victims of torture or martyrs of the revolution
I am writing for the sake of history, so we remember Bouazizi, fuse of the Tunisian revolution, who was the first drop of rain and the beginning of hope
Rehab goes on to say: مسيحيين ومسلمين
صغارًا وشبابًا وكبارًا
أغنياء وفقراء
خريجو الجامعة الأمريكية والألمانية وغير متعلمين
سكان الأحياء الراقية وسكان العشوائيات
وحدهم الظلم والقهر والفساد والتعذيب The Egyptians have united for the first time – Islamists, Salafis, Muslim Brotherhood, the Left
Christians and Muslims
United by injustice, oppression, corruption and torture

She adds: فلم لا يتحد المصريون وقد ولدوا من رحم واحد وشكلوا من نسيج واحد
نسيج شكلته ممارسات الفساد والظلم والقهر والفساد
لكل من تعاطف مع مبارك بعد خطابه الأخير
أنسيتم ما ضاع من مصر في ثلاثين عامًا
أنسيتم ضحايا العبارة وحريق المسرح
أنسيتم خالد سعيد وكل المعذبين من قبله
أنسيتم احتكار أحمد عز الذي يؤكد الجميع أنه كان واجهة علاء وجمال مبارك والي القوه اليوم ككبش فداء وهربوا إلى لندن تاركين والدهم لنا
أنسيتم دخل قناة السويس
أنسيتم كل ذلك لمجرد أنه قال لقد أفنيت عمري في خدمة البلد
انسيتم خطابه عند تولي الرئاسة سنة 81 عندما وعد أنه لن يمضي أكثر من فترتين فأمضى خمسة
وقال بأن الكفن لا جيوب له فاتضح أن أكفانه هو وأولاده وأعوانه لها جيوب كثيرة The Europeans united regardless of their faiths and languages
Why shouldn’t Egyptians unite when they have been born from one womb and formed from one fabric
A fabric woven from the experience of corruption, injustice, oppression and more corruption
And to those who sympathise with Mubarak after his recent speech:
Have you forgotten what Egypt has lost in the last thirty years?
Have you forgotten the victims of the ferry and the theatre fire?
Have you forgotten Khaled Saeed, and all the victims of torture before him?
Have you forgotten the monopoly of Ahmed Ezz, who everyone asserts was the front for Alaa and Gamal Mubarak who have now discarded him as a scapegoat, and escaped to London leaving their father for us?
Have you forgotten the income of the Suez Canal?
Have you forgotten all this just because he said, “I have spent my entire life in the service of my country”?
Have you forgotten his speech on becoming president in 1981, when he promised that he would not spend more than two terms as president – and spent five?
He said that a shroud has no pockets – but it’s clear that his shroud and those of his sons and his cronies have many pockets Rehab concludes: وبعث له ثورة تونس وهروب بن علي لكنه لم يتعظ
ولم يتخل عن عناده العسكري العتيد
أخيرًا أذكر لكل من يحب مصر حتى وإن لم تتفق معي ادع اليوم لمصر وانتصار الحق وهلاك للظالمين God has granted him a lot, but imagine he has neglected him, and sent him many warnings, including the death of his grandson, who was spared from inheriting such a dishonorable legacy
He sent him the Tunisian revolution and Ben Ali’s flight, but Mubarak did not take the warning
He didn't depart from his usual military stubbornness
Finally, I remind all of you who love Egypt, even if you do not agree with me, pray today for Egypt, and the victory of truth, and the destruction of oppressors
Iran: Protesting in the name of Egypt and Tunisia · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage of Tunisia Revolution 2011. Iranian opposition leaders, Mir Hussein Mousavi and Mehdi Karubi, have applied for permission to stage a rally in support of revolts in Egypt and Tunisia, on February 14 (25 Bahman) their websites said.
This poses a dilemma for the Iranian government who themselves stamped mass protests one year ago.
The news motivated several cyber activists to add their 'green touch' to the internet, sharing their ideas and hopes for a new era for the Iranian protest movement.
A 25 Bahman (14 February) Facebook page was recently launched, and already more than 18,000 people have joined.
On this page there is information for protesters to print and distribute, and videos including newscasts about the Egyptian protest movement.
The poster below invites people to demonstrate in Tehran on February 14 and also mention Article 27 of the Iranian Constitution which provides for freedom of assembly without arms, and as long as the assemblies "are not detrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam."
Several people have written comments and shared their opinion on the upcoming demonstration such as suggesting slogans about the economic corruption of the Iranian regime, similar to those for protests in Tunisia and Egypt.
Cyber activists have also gone to work in several other big cities such as Shiraz, Isfahan and Tabriz local Facebook pages.
Khodnevis reports that protesters have begun to write "25 Bahman, our Anger Day" on bank notes.
Sokhanesabz writes :
... three days before 14 February (25 Bahman) on the anniversary of the revolution, we should go to the rooftops and chant "Down with the dictator".
We should start inform people several days before the demonstration not just the night before. This post is part of our special coverage of Tunisia Revolution 2011.
Saudi Arabia: Cheers for Our Egyptian Brothers! · Global Voices
In their reaction to the news that Hosni Mubarak stepped down, Saudis joyfully congratulated Egyptians on their victory, especially those in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo, the epicentre of massive protests calling for an end to the Mubarak regime that rocked Egypt for 18 days.

Really Happy!
Noura Alkhudair is proud:

This post is part of our special coverage on Algeria Protests 2011.
The protesters for democracy have already taken down two dictators in Tunisia and Egypt but the Algerian authorities have been successful so far in holding down protests that have started soon after the Tunisian revolts in early January 2011.

Macedonia: Problems With Transparent Online Reporting of Air Pollution in Skopje · Global Voices
According to the blog of GreenBox NGO, Skopje's city government is not interested in providing funds for the online system that informs citizens about the current levels of air pollution.
The automatic system for measuring pollution, located in the center of Skopje, caused quite a stir when it reported alarming levels of air pollution last year.
Some observers related the presence of the cancerous PM10 dust particles to the government-funded construction boom in the Center municipality, which had been turned into a giant construction site through the Skopje 2014 project.
The surrounding area is also an epicenter of the activities of the so-called "urban mafia" that uses connections within the local government to change zoning laws and convert public parks, parking lots and small houses to huge and profitable apartment blocks, office spaces and shops.
The "Skopje Breathing" online system , owned by the City of Skopje, stopped functioning at the beginning of January 2012 (1, 2; mk), after several media outlets (1, 2, 3, 4; mk) reported that the air quality was still poor.
The webpage displayed this text: "Software upgrade is under way.
The application will soon be available."
Screen shot of Skopje Breething monitoring system, which is 'in construction' since early January 2012.
GreenBox blog posted the following:
Would you like to know about the quality of the air in the center of Skopje?
Then you need to put on your snow shoes, parka, hat, scarf and gloves and trek to Macedonia Street to check the information by looking at the display near the Šmizla statue.
The website "Skopje Breathing," which published a live data feed until Christmas , is still not working, and most likely will not work in the future.

The environmental lab of the company Farmahem, which maintained the system for a year, confirmed that the issue at stake is more than a software upgrade.
Their contract has expired, and the City of Skopje has not initiated a renewal.
Farmahem allegedly wanted to upgrade the system with a public archive with the measured data, but now the citizens need to turn to the city government, which decides the destiny of this online transparency tool.
The City of Skopje representatives seem totally uninterested in ensuring that the publication of the air quality data online continues.
The spokesperson Nedelčo Krstevski says that the website appeared thanks to the initiative and goodwill of the company.
"The website was not ours.
At the moment we cannot say whether it depends on us or on Farmahem.
For us the important thing is that the measuring stations work and that the citizens can get air quality info from displays on the devices," Krstevski said.
The City representatives admit that for the "Skopje Breathing" to continue working they would need to start a public procurement procedure, which, according to them, was very complicated and included a public tender.
They do not know if that is going to happen.
"I cannot tell you anything now, neither that the site will exist, nor that it won't exist," said Krstevski.
Through "Skopje Breathing" the citizens learned that the air pollution in the capital was up to 10 times higher than the maximum allowed by law. This resulted in recommendations not to go out at all.
After the public pressure forced the city government and the Ministry of Environment to send inspections to the nearby industrial plants, the levels of pollution temporarily dropped.
According to the research by the Institute for Public Health, Skopje could avoid 117 deaths and 420 cases of serious illnesses per year if the concentration of dust dropped by a third of the current levels.
Iran: Hope, Joy, Envy as Egypt Breaks Free · Global Voices
Iranian bloggers welcomed the departure of Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak today with both joy and envy.
It is an amazing coincidence that Mubarak was brought down on exactly the 32th anniversary of the 1979 revolution when the Shah was overthrown.
Some bloggers also use the occasion to remind readers that the Green Movement is calling for demonstrations on Monday, February 14 in the name of Egypt and Tunisia.
Mamlkate Darim? (means 'What country?') writes :
Egyptians slept for 18 days in the streets and now they rejoice.
We, Iranians, have slept for 32 years ..what country do we have?
Sedaye Zendani (means 'Voice of prisoner') says :
Egyptian people got their rights.
We will go on Monday, 25 Bahman to the streets and celebrate for you.
We were supposed to get the same right as the Egyptian people, but they were smarter and got it sooner than us.
Now we must go to the streets to demand our rights, and celebrate the will of this nation for victory.
To celebrate the victory of a nation, we need neither a leader nor permission.
Mihanparast (means 'Patriot') writes with irony, "Why did Mubarak have to leave now, he could have waited two days and left with Seyed Ali ."
Rag be Rag congratulates Egyptian brothers and sisters and says, the key to victory is keeping religion and state separated.
Greenlights writes that for all the blood spilled on the ground he will take part in the 14 February demonstration.
Iran: Internet Blackout Ahead of Protest Day · Global Voices
Slow Internet and filtering is a daily reality in Iran, but in recent days reports from inside the country say that web email and secure Internet (https:) has become inaccessible, and that the Internet is so slow that anti-filtering software fails to open web pages.
The partial blackout began on Thursday, February 9, 2012.
While Iranian authorities have been silent, some bloggers speculate that the reason for the blocking is a planned protest on February 14 (in the Iranian calendar, 25 Bahman).
The Tuesday protests will mark the one year anniversary of demonstrations called by Iranian opposition leaders in 2011, in solidarity with the people's uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia.
The physical repression on this day was brutal and left at least two people dead in Tehran.

The blog Azadi-Esteqlal-Edalat (Freedom, Independence, Justice) writes :
Khamenei's regime is scared since the Green Movement has invited people to restart protests.
According to some reports, in most parts of country from Tehran to Ardebil, people have no access to Gmail, Yahoo mail, Google or Google+.
This blocking can be considered as the regime's attempt to stop Green activists from informing people to take part in demonstrations in the final days of February.
The regime's action is useless because green activists have already informed their friends and family members, and developed creative means of passing on the message, such as writing slogans on bills of money.
Dara 1390 says :
Without any doubt the February 14th demonstrations are the reason why the government has interrupted the internet.
They are afraid of any kind of demonstration in the streets.
We do not know how people will react on February 14 but the regime is making itself ready for the day.
Another blogger, Mborjan writes :
Since Thursday any access to Gmail, Facebook and https sites has become impossible, at least in Isfahan.
I heard this only happened in big cities.
In small cities and villages things are as usual.
Yadasht Ha (means 'notes') says with irony that if it becomes necessary, "We will use pigeons instead of national email."
Bani Man also reports that as the protest day approaches, the regime blocked Gmail and Faceboook.
The blogger quotes a Forbes report that as Iran cracks down online, the software Tor for anonymous online communication, is testing undetectable encrypted connections.
Thailand, Cambodia: Border conflict intensifies · Global Voices
The border row between Thailand and Cambodia has intensified in the past week as both countries exchanged fires killing several soldiers on both fronts and forcing the evacuation of nearby villages near the border.
The two Southeast Asian nations are claiming ownership of the historic Preah Vihear Temple.

RT @thaitvnews: 2 Buddhist countries fight for ruined Hindu civilization temple / which highlights the idiocy of the situation
Michael insists the border conflict is not really about the temple
Of course it’s not really about the temple.
There are plenty of temples that could be taken care of before this one.
Such a convenient way to control what people are thinking about.
And of course, such a convenient way to drum up support for a strong and well-equipped military, because in times where there is a threat of war, those who defend the motherland need all the support they can get.
Tharum Bun gathers blog and tweet reactions from Cambodia.
Here’s one from Albeiro Rodas
As Khmer is oldest in the Indochina Peninsula than Thailand, at least as a political state, it is like Cambodia is Greece and Thailand is Italy.
Cambodia is first and it is impossible to deny it.
Thailand has been built over the Cambodian territory, history and culture.
It does not mean that Thailand is not authentic or it is an invader, but Thai people should recognize it not in humilitation, but in brotherly afection.
Cambodia comes from suffering and got a strong spirit.
The Thai leaders should wake to lucidity, suspend any agression and sit down with their Khmer brothers, as they are, to build peace and common development for their peoples.
Life in Rural Thailand hopes the conflict will end soon
It’s very disappointing as it is a magnificent place to visit.
I am not a temple tourist at all but this place is something else due to it’s location on a cliff that is 525 metres high offering an amazing view over the plains of Cambodia The actual temple is 45kms away from our village and the conflict has never caused any concern in the pat.
This time however shells appear to be falling a long way away from the temple which is quite worrying.
Khon Kaen criticizes tourism officials in Thailand who seem to be not a bit worried about the impact of the border fighting on the tourism industry
The border fighting was not some little story buried on page 32 of local newspapers.
It was on the front page of Fox news yesterday.
And, if the TAT (Tourism Authority of Thailand) Governor thinks that no one saw this or that no one will react negatively, he needs to have his head examined.
Many readers believe that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or ASEAN should have done something to mediate and settle the issue.
This was illustrated by Sacrava through a cartoon sketch that he posted on his website
Thai twitter users are using the hashtags #thaiborder and #thaikhmer to monitor the situation in the border.
The Thai & Khmer People who Want Peace Facebook page was created by citizens who reject war.
Here is one message from Topza Aung
Shame on cambodian and thai governments who are corrupted by greed, money, and power and trying to start over the war.
We the people of these two countries do not have any idea.
We are so innocent but unconciously are just tools to create hatred toward each other because our governments lie and manipulate us through fake and made-up news/media.
Guys, keep in mind that, it's cambodian politics vs thai politics, not the two people of these two countries.
The Son of the Khmer Empire accuses Thailand’s Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva of using the issue to improve his political image
This border war between Cambodia and Thailand has nothing to do with protecting Thai sovereignty but the political interests for a group of selfish and nationalism elite persons esp. the Democrats and its alliance.
This war is motivated because Abhishit hopes:
- to make himself looks like a strongman and gains popularity for this war against Cambodia.
- to unite Thai people to continue to support his weak government and win the next election in April as he has already made an appeal to Thai people to unite for the war against Cambodian border recently.
The same blogger also accuses Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen of manipulating the issue to strengthen his leadership
- His popularity may gain
- People will forget about their economic hardship caused by his incompetent leadership,
- He will have the reason to buy more weapon and ask for more money for his personal soldiers,
- He hope to gain more vote and cling on to power for years to come.
Morocco: Student Jailed for Insulting King in Video · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Morocco Protests 2011.
According to one Moroccan news website Mr. Haydour had no legal assistance during the hearing and the Court did not appoint a lawyer to defend the accused in accordance with the Moroccan law.
Under Moroccan law the king is considered "inviolable."
But the Moroccan constitution also guarantees (Article 25) "freedom of thought, opinion and expression in all its forms."
The ruling comes less than a week after an 18-year-old appeared before a court in the capital Rabat accused of committing a crime of lèse-majesté by posting pictures and videos on Facebook mocking King Mohammed VI.
The news of the sentence against Mr. Haydour provoked some strong reactions on social networks.
Rasta Basta tweets:
@Basta: just a thought: in #Morocco defaming God does not lead to prison, defaming the king does, for 3 yrs; any conclusions? #HR #ArabSpring
Samia Errazzouki tweets:
@Charquaouia: I've lost count of the people jailed in Morocco since the new constitution and elections for merely expressing themselves with words.
Burrito tweets:
@Burrito_SB: How many people should get arrested for simply expressing their opinion do we need to realize that nothing has changed in #morocco #maroc
Despite sustained growth, Morocco still suffers from high unemployment, especially prevalent among the youngest with more than a quarter of graduates unable to find a job.
Many Moroccan cities witness daily demonstrations over unemployment often led by university graduates who wish to integrate the public sector.
Last month four of these protesters set themselves on fire in the capital Rabat.
One of them lost his life.
But it is in the city of Taza where the social tension reached its peak.
The city witnessed several weeks of violent clashes between demonstrators and anti-riot police, culminating on February 1st when the police proceeded to a house-to-house search, arresting several suspected rioters.
On Tuesday, 17 individuals from Taza were sentenced to up to eight months in jail for "vandalism and destruction of public property," the local media reported.

Iran: Whose Martyr is He? · Global Voices
The Iranian pro-regime and opposition forces have each been battling to claim Saleh Jaleh as their martyr.
He was killed by gunfire on February 14 when the opposition demonstrated in Tehran and several other cities.
Sane Jaleh, 26, was a student of dramatic literature at Tehran Arts University.
A Sunni Muslim, Sane was from Paveh in the Kurdistan Province.
While Iranian pro-government websites claim he was a Basij militia member, killed by the opposition, opposition sites say he was a protester.
Both sides accuse each other of trying to steal Saleh's identity.
Pro-regime sites published his photo and his Basij membership card, while opposition sites published a photo of him with the late high ranking cleric, Ayathollah Montazeri, a leading anti-government figure.
Reza Sajadi, the secretary of Tehran Arts University’s Islamic Association, and a close friend of Sane Jaleh, told the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran that despite threats made against him, he strongly denies his friend’s membership in the Basij organization.
On YouTube, a short film titled 'A Brick in the Wall' shows Saneh's participation in a film with a protest message, inspired by Pink Floyd's 'The Wall'.
Greenofred, an Iranian blogger, says that today the killers' of Saleh organised the funeral of their victim while security agents did not let Saleh's classmates to leave the university...
In an interview with VOA Persian, his brother said that Saleh was not a member of the militia and that it was his pro-government cousin who misused his photo to make a fake Basij card to publish on pro-regime sites... The family is under pressure.
Faryad Sabz also says Saleh was buried without the presence of his classmates.
Several pro-government bloggers such as Peynevesht tried to provide answers to the doubts of the authenticity of the Basij card.
Saleh's sad story reminds me of a phrase that I heard at the beginning of a famous Western movie involving bounty hunters: "When life has no value, death gets some."
Macedonia: Violent Inter-Ethnic Incident on Skopje Fortress · Global Voices
On Sunday, Feb. 13, 2011, the police failed to effectively separate an ethnic Macedonian and an ethnic Albanian mobs and prevent them from clashing around the old Skopje Fortress.
The two large groups of mostly young men had come there to protest for and against the construction of a church-like building, which the government claims should become a museum.
Some of the results include six injured civilians and two injured policemen, and alarmingly high levels of general fear and hate speech on-line.
The incident was the culmination of a chain of events of the last two weeks.
31, some media revealed that the government had started building "an object" within the medieval Skopje Fortress, called Kale (a Turkish word for "fort").
This caused an uproar among ethnic Albanian politicians, including coalition partners in the government from the Democratic Union for Integration (DUI).
DUI demanded cessation of the construction of any "religious object" that did not reflect the overall heritage of the area.
Pasko Kuzman, archeologist and head of the Culture Ministry's Department for Protection of Cultural and Historical Heritage, appointed by the ethnic Macedonian VMRO-DPMNE, a senior coalition partner, claimed that the works would pause until all the misunderstandings have been resolved.
In statements relayed by the media he claimed that the building would not serve as a church , but would house artifacts found on the site.
However, reports that workers were being brought in to continue the work during the night caused "a group of ethnic Albanian citizens led by high officials of DUI" (formulation by the Dnevnik daily), including the mayor of nearby Čair, the minister of health and the deputy minister of internal affairs, to storm the construction site during the night of Feb. 10, chase the workers away and do some damage to the walls.
Some of the high officials later claimed they had come to the site not as participants, but to calm the population.
On Saturday, blogger Neutralec warned that the ongoing call for ethnic Macedonians to go to the fortress to "assess the damage" and/or "defend the church" (which, he reminded, was not a church, according to the government) on Sunday, could only lead to further manipulation:
Do not make war for the interest of others, someone will gain political points even from this!
Viktor Arsovski provided an exposé of the subsequent events and the impact of social media.
He pointed out that, unlike in Tunisia, Egypt and elsewhere, the organizing power of social media in Macedonia was not used to benefit the people:
...a group of "supporters" of the building of the church (i.e., a Macedonian football fan group Komiti), and a group of "supporters" of its destruction (i.e., an Albanian football fan group Shverceri) gathered on the same location at Skopje Fortress to express their opinions through a "peaceful" protest.
One could have assumed what would happen between these two groups.
Mass beating, stoning, eight injured, one knifing, panic in the media, critiques against the politicians, ethnic bigotry...
The difference between this and other similar stupid incidents is the role of Facebook.
According to Radio Free Europe , the protests were organized by informal Facebook groups and the Albanian NGO "Wake Up."
Currently, a new protest is being organized on Kale for Feb. 19.
A FB group with thousands of members calls to protest, posting hideous photos and hate speech (to put it mildly).
And this group is not the only one.
There are others with similar violent content.
A group with over 4,000 members Church on Kale , both ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian, arguing and exchanging insults and calls for ethnic cleansing.
A similarly sordid story of ethnic insults and hate speech continues within FB groups Museum-Church on Kale and Against the Church on Skopje Fortress .
One click is enough to reveal the age of these people - most of them are teenagers and college students!
Interestingly, one can see that most of these young "minds" share similar interests .
On Facebook, alongside verbal provocations, the most frequent means to challenge the other ethnic group is by using YouTube videos.
This service has grown into a vast library of awful hate-filled videos in the years before Facebook gained prominence... calls for Greater Albania and Greater Macedonia, calls for ethnic cleansing, death, genocide, clips from the .
For years the .MK institutions have been ignoring the existence of these repulsive videos, even though I believe it would only take a credible notice for YouTube to remove them...
In retrospect, blogger Volancommented :
An old fishing trick is to muddy the waters, and if you hunt on land to hunt within a mist...
It is getting clearer that someone is muddying the waters, in this case the hunt is on - on voters.
Hunting voters is especially important in the hunting season, i.e., the looming election season.
From this perspective, the muddying of the waters on Skopje Fortress becomes clearer.
Hidden in the fog, one side is building a church under the smokescreen of a museum church.
The others demolish the museum church.
The most puzzling aspect is that both 'sides' sit within the government/the ruling administration.
The smaller opposition parties also sit on the sidelines trying to catch some fish as well....
The hunt on the undecided voters, who comprise more than half of the electorate, is especially sweet...
Unfortunately, only the small fry was left swimming in the muddy waters of Skopje Kale: football fan groups... with worrying calls heard in 2001... The big fish sit in the cabinets of power and observe.
Civil - Center for Freedom, an NGO, issued a call on their blog for Macedonia without violence and divisions - in Macedonian, Albanian and English:
The government has to start doing its job, not to play a role of a helpless observer and commentator on events.
A huge portion of responsibility for the deterioration of inter-ethnic relations lies precisely in the practices of this government.
This particularly applies to the adoption and implementation of projects that have nothing to do with the needs and realities of this country.
Civilasked the government to stop controversial projects, and act in a transparent manner and build consensus.
It also reminded political parties, the civil sector and individual citizens about their responsibilities in maintaining peace and stopping nationalism and religious hatred:
Do not let obsession and madness take hold of you.
This situation is not conducive to good for you; neither is for generations to come.
A war has inflicted much harm.
Another one would mean disaster for this country.
What political figures say, sometimes may sound good, but is mostly motivated by their thirst for power and popularity.
And personal gain.
The walls are raised high above our heads.
Division is our reality.
Further divisions can also mean setting new, physical frontiers between people.
All of us know that it involves war and bloodshed.
And that brings good only for criminals and thugs.
Make the first step; tear down the walls that stand between you and your fellow citizens with different backgrounds or beliefs.
It will not jeopardize your identity, on the contrary, that will enrich you.
All this raises the levels of tension and concern among the ordinary citizens of Macedonia, who are not eager to participate in another Balkan bloodbath.
However, it seems that forces with powerful backing are working on stirring unrest.
For instance, local people prevented an allegedly premeditated arson attempt over a mosque in Bitola this morning.
A Facebook initiative "Monolith on Kale" provides a rare attempt to fight dread with humor.
It claims that "in 2001: A Space Odyssey the monolith helped the apes evolve.
As a religiously neutral object, planting a monolith on Kale" might aid the evolution in Macedonia too.
Unlike the previously mentioned groups, which have several thousand members/fans each, this has only about a hundred supporters so far.

Morocco: No Justice for Fouad Mourtada · Global Voices
Is creating a Facebook profile of a famous entity a crime?
Although it's been done to nearly every major celebrity (a quick search for "George W. Bush" garners over 500 results), but when Fouad Mourtada chose to mimic Prince Moulay Rachid of Morocco, he was committing a serious crime. As Sami Ben Gharbia reported on Global Voices Advocacy last week, Mourtada was arrested on February 5 after Moroccan authorities discovered his false Facebook profile of the member of the royal family.
Syria: Shock and Disbelief Over Murder of Journalists · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011/12.
Netizens covering the daily carnage in Syria on social media had to take a step back today to soak in news of more atrocities committed against humanity in the Baba Amr neighbourhood, in besieged city of Homs.
NPR media strategist Andy Carvin, who is in Tripoli, Libya, tweets:
@acarvin: I need to unplug for a bit before I say something I'll regret.
I just can't take this right now. #homs #syria
He adds:
@acarvin: Killing reporters and citizen journalists won't stop us from bearing witness.
You can't stop us. #syria #homs
And continues:
@acarvin: These reporters and citizen journos muster more bravery in a day than I ever will in a lifetime.
I am forever in their debt. #syria #homs
While Iyad El Baghdadi admits:
@Iyad_elbaghdadi: I have to take a break and cry for a bit.
See you later.
The reactions followed reports on the deaths of American journalist Marie Colvin, who works for Britain's the Sunday Times and French photographer Remi Ochlik.
According to Reuters, "shells hit the house in which they were staying and a rocket hit them when they were escaping."
Meanwhile, netizens on the ground report that a third reporter is also said to be injured, when the media centre the journalists and activists were in was attacked.
Tweets4peace accuses the Syrian regime of conducting the attack.
The Twitter user notes:
@tweet4peace: We know it is regime is because these type of missile attacks have been continuous for 19 days now.
Today was target on media centre #homs
The news created an outpouring of sympathy on Twitter, already reeling over the world's silence at the massacres being committed against Syrians protesting against Bashar Al Assad and his regime and claiming the lives of thousands of citizens.
From Egypt, Maha Abdoelenein tweets:
@mahagaber: Utter Shock & Disbelief.
Marie Colvin killed in Homs, Syria today.
I worked w her extensively on all things Egypt
Diaa Hadid notes:
@diaahadid: Rest in peace Marie Colvin, Remi Ochlik, few will die as honorably, telling the world of what others sought to conceal
And Rania Zabaneh reminds us:
@RZabaneh: #Syria is becoming a deathtrap for journalists.
This is OUTRAGEOUS: EIGHT journalists killed since 2012; FOUR in #Homs.
Meanwhile, CNN reporter Arwa Damon concludes:
@arwaCNN: RIP 2 our colleagues killed in #homs, the price we pay 2 shed light on atrocities, the price #syria pays everyday 4 freedom

Video: Explosive Chinese Popcorn · Global Voices
cc-by-sa Bunchofgrapes
Videos of a Chinese popcorn making technique are doing their rounds on the internet.
While, for many, popcorn popping has a unique rhythm to it that trickles from a single popping kernel to a deluge of pings and pops; in China, popcorn pops with a bang.
The Puff Machine by Augapfel CCBY
Ah, it's all coming back to me now, my childhood in China during the 1980's.
It was always the same old man on a trike, and the throng of children who was there as much for the popcorn as for the little explosions and clouds of escaping steam.
Each little plastic bag sold for 10 cents, and for 50 cents he will pop a whole can with the corn or rice that you brought yourself.
It always amazed me that a couple of litres of corn at the bottom of a sack would fill it to the brim after popping.
Popcorn﻿ pops because the pressure on the inside exceeds the pressure on the outside of the hull.
Heating it inside a sealed container forces the pressures to be equal until the door is opened and the pressure on the outside of the hull drops dramatically, making all the kernels pop at the same time.
Simple science/engineering.
Maybe the boom works as advertising: hear it and come get freshly popped popcorn.
However, in case you missed the bang, maybe the wailing car alarms will help:
Palestine: "I Support Turkey" · Global Voices
The Turkish-led flotilla which attempted to break the blockade of Gaza has strained Turkish-Israeli relations, while gaining Turkey much respect in the Arab world.
One Gaza blogger has decided to show her appreciation for Turkey's stance in a practical way - by starting a campaign to buy Turkish goods.
Samaher Khazendar writes: During the last two days I have heard a great number of reports and news analyses concerning Turkish-Israeli relations and the issues dependent on them, and my attention was drawn to the strong focus on the economic losses that would be sustained by the two countries in the case of a complete or partial severing of Turkish-Israeli relations.
I was particularly interested in the analysis of one Israeli expert, according to whom there was previously a real change in the direction of Turkish politics, a consequence of Turkey's inability to join the European Union; this has made it take refuge in the east, and attempt to lead Arabs and Muslims instead.
Gaza-Turkey solidarity flag (reproduced under Creative Commons licence)
She continues: It occurred to me that we Arabs and Muslims are unfortunately consumers of the first rank, with a full quota of disgrace; we are neither willing nor able to change the given facts around us at the current time.
But focus with me on what is after the word "but": if we are forced to simply be consumers of what others make, and if Mr Recep Tayyip Erdoğan seeks to lead the east, and if Turkey's stance on Israel will cause it great economic losses, and if Turkey were not to sustain losses economically or politically, but instead were strengthened both economically and politically, and if this were to lead in the end to the disappointment and fury of Israel and the United States and those allied with them…
Samaher informs us: سيكون شعار الحملة
ادعم تركيا وقاطع أمريكا وإسرائيل I have decided to start a campaign to support Turkish products, and Turkey's stance and its boldness, even if these are for unseen reasons as some say.
From here, from Gaza under blockade, I call on you to blockade our enemy and help those who help us.
The campaign slogan will be: I support Turkey and boycott America and Israel.
Samaher gives a link for a website selling Turkish products made by different producers, and ends by saying: Be free, take part - there is always an alternative.

Tropical Cyclone Ivan has now left Madagascar leaving behind several regions in shambles and thousands of people without homes.
The official account by the authorities reports 2 deaths and 15,000 people without homes.
Considering that Ivan was classified as a very severe cyclonic storm with winds at up to 137 km/h, many people are wondering what might be the final count of actual casualties and damages.
As pointed out here, the intensity of the wind guts is similar to that of Hurricane Katrina.

Kuwait's Double National Day Celebrations · Global Voices
Two national day celebrations were marked in Kuwait last week - one on February 25 and the second on February 26.
Kuwait's bloggers were quick to dig into the history of the celebrations.
LiL ALiEN in a post entitled معلومات وطنية للجيل الجديد (National Information for New Generation) writes:
I've created this slide show (below) for Kuwait's independence and liberation days using photos I've taken my self between 2006 - 2008 in several locations

We may speak of as if its dull
While it seem as if amount of logic is null
Sometimes you are surrounded by culls
Which would drive you mad and make you go on quell
But there is nothing like that can make you lull
In the end the glass is not half empty but half full
Of course not everyone is happy with what happens during such celebrations.
intlxpatr describes what happened to her when she went out.
Yesterday, I was finishing up a project around 6 and heading to my next appointment when I turned onto Gulf road.
Big mistake.
Suddenly I am caught in semi-gridlock, and the worst kind, gridlock with gangs of adolescents wandering the sidewalks on both sides of the car, gridlock with main routes being barred, gridlock with people in adjacent cars spraying each other with high arching streams of foam - it’s like suddenly being in the middle of a nightmare.
mpjs gives advice of what to do during the Hala February celebrations, an extravagant celebration to mark the occasion.
After a year of waiting, Hala February Celebrations have come to their max today.
I very eagerly wait for today since I get sprayed with foam when I make eye contact with these kids.
I wait eagerly every year for this day waiting for the newspaper guy to come to my doorstep and drop the paper so that I can read about the crimes they have committed

Kyrgyzstan: From Santamania to "Subbotnik" · Global Voices
During the last two weeks, the Kyrgyz blogosphere has come up with a bunch of interesting articles, funny and witty comments along with bright photos of Santa Claus First Winter Festival in Kyrgyzstan.
The Festival was held from 23 to 25 February and spurred lots of criticism on one side - and light humor on the other - among Kyrgyz bloggers.
For instance, bretelka wonders (ru):
Have they all gone crazy?
I can’t believe that it is possible to save gifts for two billion children in Kyrgyzstan.
They will be all stolen!
Fancher seriously mulls over the idea (ru):
Guys, don’t you see the potential of this idea?
First of all, everyone knows that Santa Claus does not exist. Santa Claus is a famous global brand.
If this idea becomes very popular, then it will be a very important step towards tourism development in Kyrgyzstan (by attracting more tourists).
I think that this idea is a good and realistic.
Another witty comment by Ataman Rakin (eng):
Iiiiikkk!!!
Long beards.
They are certainly Wahhabis.
From such a funny start we can now move on to more real and serious issues that captured attention of bloggers.
Anna Yalovkina reports on Kloop.kg that Bishkek city mayor Daniyar Usenov has announced the start of two-month “subbotnik” among school pupils and students.
The word “subbotnik” derives from the Russian word “subbota” (Saturday) and means community work during which people clean streets, parks, and surroundings of schools and other public institutions.
Ladymystery notes (ru):
Not a bad idea at all.
We have always cleaned the territory of schools.
I want to see my town very clean, but unfortunately we pollute it more than we clean it.
However, the human rights defender Maksim Kuleshov protests against such a decision by Usenov and calls it a violation of child’s rights.
He says that the Soviet Union is already over and our children are not property of Mayor.
He also added that he and his team will hold protests against Bishkek Mayor’s office.
Men agrees with Kuleshov (ru):
Let the Mayor clean the city, not children from schools.
Looks like the mayor decided to build Communism in Bishkek.
Talking about protests, everybody remembers the Tulip revolution of March, 2005 when ex-president Akaev had to flee the country.
Now Kyrgyz President Kurmanbek Bakiev and newly elected Parliament want to make an amendment to the Labor Code of Kyrgyzstan which will make the 24 March a national holiday of Kyrgyzstan.
Psyho complains about such a decree (ru):
Will the Parliament ever work and do something useful?
It’s been two months since they are doing nothing.

Japan: American enka singer makes waves · Global Voices
The first ever American-born enka singer, Jero, has become the talk of the Japanese blogosphere the past weeks as he made his debut with the single "Umiyuki (Ocean Snow)".
The single came in fourth on the Oricon music chart, setting a record in the enka as well as Top 10 charts for a debut enka single.
Jero, born as Jerome White Jr. in Pittsburgh, developed his passion for enka as he grew up listening to the music with his Japanese grandmother.
As soon as he graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in information science, he moved to Japan with a dream to become an enka singer.
While working as an English teacher and later as an IT engineer, through performances at local karaoke competitions, he was discovered by a record label and eventually rose to fame in Japan.
Russia: Natalia Morar's Domodedovo Ordeal · Global Voices
Here's an excerpt from a news alert issued by the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) on Feb. 28 regarding the case of the New Times' journalist Natalia Morar (LJ user natmorar):
A citizen of Moldova, Morar was barred from entering Russia in December on a secret Federal Security Service order and deported to Chisinau.
A month later, Russian Embassy officials in Chisinau presented her with a one-paragraph statement that explained her deportation by citing a 1996 law, which says that authorities can refuse entry to foreign nationals “for the purpose of ensuring the defensive capability or security of the state or public order, or protecting the health of the general public.”
Last week, Morar married her colleague Ilya Barabanov, a Russian citizen, and tried to enter Russia yesterday as his spouse.
She was denied entry again and placed in the airport’s transit zone.
Authorities told Morar she was not allowed to enter Russia but provided no legal documents to justify the detention; they only kept referring to an “order from above.”
Barabanov, who is allowed to enter, decided to stay with his wife.
Due to Morar's health problems, she and Barabanov (LJ user kotoeb) decided to return to Moldova on March 1.
Below is the translation of Morar's first blog post since her departure from Russia (RUS), published on March 4:
Now this whole story seems totally distant and not about us.
I will not repeat everything - honestly, I don't want to at all...
I'm very tired.
For the majority of those who kept trying to pour shit over me all these months, and especially over Ilya and me these past few days, this is nothing but a matter of politics and pseudo-patriotism.
"Don't shit where you've been given shelter" and other things like that.
You are talking of politics, you are talking of the state's sovereign right, you are making bold statements - anonymously, however - and meanwhile I cannot comprehend the simplest of things...
I still haven't received an answer from anyone as to why I cannot live in a country that has long become my home. My dearest person and my closest friends are here...
I can't understand this at all.
I'll just say this - our marriage with Ilya is not fake, we've been together for a long time.
The Domodedovo story was not a staged in advance PR action for the New Times magazine, we were acting on our own behalf, we are two adult people.
Many are asking me now why we had to do this show.
I won't try to make them change their minds.
It was not a show for me.
For me, this is the country in which I am not allowed to live.
For me, this is the person I'm not allowed to be with.
For me, this is the magazine I'm not allowed to work for.
If I had been stronger, I would have stayed at Domodedovo for a month.
I'm feeling better.
Mama is feeling worse.
We had two anonymous phone calls to our home phone number, with threats against me.
Both were placed at night.
Both times mama answered the phone.
Yesterday we had to call an ambulance to resuscitate her.
This I will never forgive.
I could've forgiven other things, but this - never.
A huge thank you to all those who were close and who are with me now.
There are still more of you than all of them added together.

Iran: Students protest against "gender apartheid" · Global Voices
Hundreds of students continued a protest at Shiraz University against "gender apartheid" on Tuesday 4th of March.
The students want their university to put an end to a policy that began in February of separating men and women into different classrooms.
The students also asked the President of the university to resign and demanded better conditions in their cafeteria and dormitories.
They also want to have the right to choose their own delegates.
On March 4th, the protest movement entered its 8th day and several bloggers covered the story, while mainstream media in country ignored it.
Here is a video film of one of student protest movements, where the students chant: "It is our final message, student movement is ready for rebellion".
In a blog that calls itself "Socialist Students of Bahonar department of Shiraz", we read:
A couple of hundred students chanted slogans such as "Security and peace is our absolute right" (the Iranian government usually uses a nuclear energy is our absolute right slogan).
The university is not a military base.
The blogger adds that the university authorities promised protesters they would deal with their demands in the first days of demonstrations. But it seems nothing happened in reality.
The blogger says that the freedom of students has been restricted in the university because of military presence that enforces discrimination against women and girls.
Another blogger, "Socialist students of literature at Shiraz University", protests against the separation of genders in classes, and calls it a crime against humanity.
The blogger writes that some students have been mistreated and that the growing military presence is disturbing for students.
Ta Azadi 86 writes that the protest movement goes on while the authorities grow.
The blogger says:
About 10 students were asked to appear in court.
Several university professors were among the students.
Basiji forces wanted to disrupt the demonstration but student resistance pushed them away.
AmirKabir Khabarnameh, a leading student information website, writes Fa] that several students' families were contacted by security forces and asked to stop their children from participating in the protest movement.

Israel: Bedouin Youth Use IM to Bypass Cultural Prohibitions · Global Voices
Adnan Gharabiya, 34, lives in Wadi al-Na’am, a Bedouin community adjacent to Ramat Hovav in the south of Israel.
The place is not connected to the electricity grid or to running water.
While working on his thesis, Gharabiya discovered that instant messaging applications are extremely popular among Bedouin youth, the poorest, most neglected segment of Israel’s population.
Girls find IM service extremely useful as it allows them to bypass cultural prohibitions and not be scrutinized for chatting with boys, or even falling in love.
Quotes and link from an interview with Gharabiya below:
“The tribal structure is very strong, and a teenage boy up to age 18 is almost constantly around the tribe and the community,” says Gharabiya.
“The Bedouin are usually isolated and cut off also from the rest of Israeli society, from the rest of the Arab sector, which lives mostly in the north, and from Arabs in other countries.
Chat rooms open a window.” The Internet made the greatest change in the lives of young girls.
“In Bedouin society there is rather strict separation of the sexes, and a chat room is the only place where they can talk with members of the opposite sex,” says Gharabiya. “It is especially significant for the girls, because their social circle is even smaller, and their freedom of movement is limited.
Not all of them can leave their parents’ community.
Unlike the boys, girls are not allowed to go to town after classes, or to visit friends.
In this respect, technology is very important.”
“In our society, the girl must be respectable and act moderately, because what’s important for a girl in this society is her reputation,” said A., one of the girls interviewed for the research.
“In Bedouin society, it is forbidden to talk to a boy, to send him letters and to fall in love with him … but in a chat room, no one knows if you’re talking to boys there.
They think you’re a good, respectable girl, and that’s the main thing.
You write to people while no one sees you, but you and your real-life behavior are always under scrutiny.”
Chat rooms let them bypass customs and prohibitions, and overcome the strict limits in traditional society, primarily the separation of the sexes and the severe restrictions imposed on women.
“There is a lot more freedom in a chat room,” says Gharabiya.
“Among the family, it is not common to discuss all subjects, primarily when the children are adolescents.
In a chat room, you can discuss everything, if you find someone who is receptive.”
Since late January, 3 severe tropical cyclones have affected Madagascar tremendously, the latest being cyclone Jokwe who made landfall in the northern region of Madagascar, destroying 40 homes and leaving 400 people stranded in Nosy-be.
The city of Antsiranana was also affected but not as extensively and Jokwe is now destroying homes on the coast of Mozambique.
The sad pun about the current cyclonic season being a cruel "Jok(w)e" from nature notwithstanding, bloggers urge the authorities for more adequate preparedness with respect to natural disasters.
An analysis of the reasons for the extent of the catastrophe once landfall is made could help prevent more damages, especially considering that a 4th tropical cyclone, Kamba, is now forming 700 miles east of Madagascar.

World: Global March Against the Syrian Dictator · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Syria Protests 2011.
In March 2011, when Syrians started taking to the streets to demand freedom and justice, it was hard to imagine that a year later the regime would have killed thousands of people and tortured and arrested countless others.
The city of Homs has been besieged since the beginning of February and suffers an unprecedented crackdown against its entire population, with a death toll of 100 every day.
While international powers have not agreed on the need to pressure the Assad regime, global citizens solidarity with Syrians has been increasing and it will likely garner more support now that we are reaching the anniversary of the Syrian revolution.
An initiative called Global March for Syria aims to take people from all over the world to the streets on March 15, 16 and 17 in support of the Syrian people's struggle.
The campaign is explained in a video called "Against a Dictator" that has been widely shared online:
Marches for Syria are already planned in 16 cities, and the list keeps growing every day.
Activists have created a Facebook event with information on the different marches, where they encourage citizens worldwide to stand with Syria against oppression:
One year since the Syrian revolution began.
One year of violence against peaceful protesters and innocent civilians.
One year of bloodshed.
And one year of a brave stance against great evil, but the Syrian people have vowed to never stop until the fall of the regime, until they gain freedom and dignity.
On March 15-17, 2012 let's stand with Syria against oppression and take a moment to remember the thousands of lives sacrificed since March 15, 2011.
The list of marches (please add yours to the Facebook event and as a comment to this post) are as follows: Toronto, Canada Washington DC, USA Ottawa, Canada Calgary, Canada Montreal - Canada Chicago, Illinois, US London, UK Geneva, Switzerland Seine, France, Paris, France, Paris, France, Bergen, Norway, Zürich, Switzerland Germany, Munich San Francisco, USA New Zealand

Video HUB: Protecting women activists' rights around the world · Global Voices
Witness' The HUB Beta brings us three videos recorded at the "Human Rights for Women; Human Rights for All" event, where 3 strong women who defend other women´s rights speak about the International Campaign on Women Human Rights Defenders.
From the campaign's contextualization website:
The International Campaign on Women Human Rights Defenders is an international initiative for the recognition and protection of women who are activists advocating for the realization of all human rights for all.
The campaign asserts that women fighting for human rights and particularly focusing on women's human rights face specific violations in the course of their work because of their sex and gender.
In addition, the Campaign focuses on the situation of human rights activists defending women’s rights and in particular calls attention to the violations experienced by lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and other rights activists on grounds of their sex and gender identities.
The identities of these actors as well as the nature of the rights they strive to uphold are both factors that make them the focus of the Campaign.
There are currently 3 videos on The Hub, and they have been chosen as the Editor´s picks: Sunila Abeyesekera of INFORM in Sri Lanka talking about the campaign and how the implementation of gender specific strategies for human rights work is necessary,Lydia Alpizar from AWID who talks about why what she calls "unsexy" topics such as financing are vital for gender equality matters: "without resources there is no implementation of hard-won political commitment to uphold women's human rights" and Aisha Shaheed from the Global Campaign to Stop Killing and Stoning, explaining why crimes against women based on tradition or religion should be stopped.
Following, the 3 videos on strong women who are striving to protect the rights of other women, as uploaded by Violeta Krasnic.
So what is the Hub?
It´s a website where anyone can post videos related to human rights, so that they get a wider audience that is interested in the subject, instead of having to dig through regular video uploading websites to find the content they want.
It´s a way to get human rights content directly to those who are interested in seeing it.

Palestine: "I'm Afraid of “Taaakh” and Shiver When I See it" · Global Voices
In a promotion for one of Al Jazeera’s documentaries about the Israeli occupation of Palestine, a young Palestinian girl describes her living.
With her little words, she captures the hearts of almost everybody who watches this video… and still, her words say nothing of what I can feel whenever I see her on TV.
Palestinian blogger Shaltaf (Ar) transcribes her words in Arabic. اجت القذيفة من فوق دخلت عالشباك بعدين كسرت كل الشبابيك والدار انحرقت
حتى نضارتي الي ابوي جابللي اياها ما فرحتش عليها حتى الاسوارة اللي امي جابتها الحلق حتى الخواتم ما فرحتش عليهم
The bomb entered from the window, then it broke all the other windows before the house burned. All my things were broken.
My toys were broken.
And a lot my other things melted.
We threw everything with the garbage.
Even my clothes were thrown into the garbage.
If you only smelled our clothes.
Let the Jews come and smell our clothes and see our house.
Even my eye glasses that my father brought to me, I couldn’t be happy with.
Even the bracelets that my mother bought to me, and the earrings and the rings, I couldn’t be happy with.
How am I supposed to be happy with them.. and my necklace ... and all that.
How am I supposed to be happy with my things?
I am afraid of “Taaaakh” (the sound of shooting) even .. and I shiver whenever I see it happening.

Macedonia: March for Peace Scheduled for Saturday, March 17 · Global Voices
The people of multi-ethnic Macedonia are organizing a March for Peace this Saturday as an expression of concern that the recent hate crimes are a harbinger of civil war.
The march is scheduled for Saturday, March 17, 2012, at 2pm in Skopje City Park, and the word is being spread via this Facebook event , Tweetvite event , the Twitter account Zaedno za mir (Together for Peace) and the hashtags #PEACEmk, #ZaednoZaMir, #zzm or #marshnamirot.
The initiative is organized by activists and around 50 civil society organizations, with the involvement of artists and media personalities from all local ethnic groups who do not want to see a reprise of the 2001 conflict (also known as the "second halftime" concept).
They say:
Together for Peace poster.
The symbol of overlapping word balloons also spreads as a Facebook profile pic.
We are:
FOR Peace!
FOR Living together instead of living side by side!
FOR Calming of the tensions!
FOR The good of all people!
FOR Friendship!
FOR Society without violence!
Without prejudice and manipulation!
We welcome all who strive towards the reduction of the tensions and raising of the awareness of living together!
This is an issue of civic and human consciousness.
Let’s plant the seed of love.
We want it and we can do it!
The march comes as a reaction to a series of violent inter-ethnic developments, including slow and controversial reactions by the authorities to the murder in Gostivar after/during an argument over parking space on February 28, the after-funeral protests and the stoning of select shops, followed by a series of violent incidents involving "spontaneous" "revenge" attacks - beatings of the passersby on the streets of several Macedonian cities and in the public transport in Skopje, leaving dozens of people with serious injuries.
All this was accompanied by biased media coverage, up to the level of open hate speech in most of the ethnically/linguistically-divided commercial media that remain operational.
The period of the deterioration of the security situation in Macedonia started in late January, and was preceded by long-term efforts of nationalist mobilization instigated by the ruling ethnic Macedonian and ethnic Albanian parties within their "own" ethnic groups, and judicial "tradition" of impunity or leniency towards perpetrators of de facto hate crimes.
(The concept of hate crime is not present as such within the Macedonian legal system, even though instigating ethnic or racial hatred is a felony.)
March for Peace poster by Nebojsha Galevski - Bane.
Participants of the initiative have been expressing their commitment to live together with their peers from different ethnic groups by providing translations of the call, and also by producing various other works.
For instance, graphic designer Nebojsha Gelevski-Bane created the poster above, and theater and film director Srđan Janićijević posted another pro-peace graphic, and a video ad.

Iranian Bloggers on international women's day · Global Voices
Women's rights have been severely restricted in the last two years in Iran.
Some women activists have been jailed, and Zanan Magazine, a leading women's magazine was banned.
Many others have been victims of security forces violence for the way they dress.
The Iranian government does not recognise March 8 as International Women's Day and there is no official public celebration.
Despite very difficult circumstances, Iranian women continue their progress in many areas and activists have supported the jailed women activists.
A few months ago, Kosoof, a leading photo blogger, published some photos showing a solidarity action of women for two arrested activists.
Several bloggers, women and men, remembered this day and share their thoughts and feelings about women in Iranian society.
Asieh Amini, an activist for women’s equal rights, says March 8 is a day of protest against any gender discrimination.
Freekeyboard says March 8 makes him compares his dreams to reality.
He says:
It is not my March 8.
In my March 8 people would be happy and I would dance in the streets.
On March 8 there would be no difference between man or woman, all people are equal because all are human beings.
In the March 8 that I like, there are no cops to repress.
Men and women are happy and dancing.
No woman shouts we want equal rights… this March 8 is not here, but only in my mind, and in my dream.
The blogger adds that in his March 8, women aren't sent to jail because they ask people to sign a petition for equal rights between men and women.
The Association of Iranian bloggers, Penlog, says in a statement, that Iranian women are considered as second class citizens by the Islamic Republic’s laws.
Despite all pressures and discrimination, Iranian women continue their presence in all professional fields.
Z8un has published several photos of working women.
Maryam Majd, blogger and photographer, has also published several photos showing Iranian women involved in different sports.
She showed Iranian women's activities and problems in another set of photos here.
Kuwait: Copying the West in Everything · Global Voices
Kuwaiti blogger Frankom (Ar) urges his readers to stop copying the West in everything - from reality television shows, to movies and even when speaking to friends.
I wanted to count the things that we do .. do I say Kuwaitis, or Gulf nationals or Arabs? (You are free to select here) that we copy from the West and discovered that they are a lot.
Do I start with the copied television shows?
Or the weird haircuts?
Or the Egyptian movies (since that is our version of Hollywood) which are copies of foreign movies?
I don't know whether we have become a scanner or a lifeless photocopy machine.
Frankom admits to understanding English - but it isn't a language he is ready to blog in.
He says:
هذا لايعني أنني سأهجر اللغة الام وهي العربية ولن أتخلى عنها في كتاباتي … أووه لماذا أكتب كل هذه الاسطر الفارغة ؟
I find it extremely difficult to understand and learn English and this is why I don't use it a lot in writing.
In fact, I use it rarely or link from other sources.
A friend asked me to blog in English but that will be mission impossible!
This doesn't mean that I don't understand the language and its words and if asked to speak in English, I would.
I have loved a weird and long story to learn what I know so far. But this doesn't mean that I will abandon my mother tongue, which is Arabic, in my writings. Why am I even writing those empty words?
Following this introduction, Frankom comes face to face with an incident outside a restaurant in Kuwait.
He sets the scene as follows:
المهم في هذا الموضوع … يا أخي انته كويتي أو عربي ماينفع تقول (كلب - حيوان - تيس - بقرة - خرتيت - خنزير … الخ الخ ) ياخي لاتسب مو أحسن ؟؟ لازم تكون ماشي على الموضة وتقول كلمات أعتقد أنك ماتعرف اصلا شنو معنى تلك الكلمات ؟
أعيد وأقول … قمنا بتقليد الكثير الكثير من الاشياء والله يستر من القادم
After having dinner at one of the American restaurants overlooking the Gulf Road, I came across three people sitting on a table outside, talking to each other loudly.
One of them was fat and living the role that he understands English.
After every three Kuwaiti or Arabic words, he would say (F***) and then repeat the word about four to six times.
One of the three people asked him (he who seems to have just picked up the word from a movie, television show or someone else) to lower his voice.
What concerns me here is that this Kuwaiti or Arab could have substituted the word with another derogatory word (like dog, animal, goat, cow, hippopotamus or pig) or he could have sworn in Arabic??
Did he really have to walk in the footsteps of fashion and use words I am sure he didn't understand their meanings.
I repeat and say, that we are copying a lot .. and may God have mercy on us from what is coming next.
Total lunar eclipse inspires vloggers · Global Voices
Videos from different countries show the total lunar eclipse, just in case you missed it or wish to relive the moment.The only total lunar eclipse we'll see in 2008 and the last one until Dec 21st 2010 took place this past February 20th.
A lunar eclipse is an event that happens when the full moon passes through the Earth´s shadow, and a total lunar eclipse means that it passes through the darkest part of the shadow, known as the umbra.
According to the NASA, the 3 hour and 26 minute eclipse was "visible from South America and most of North America (on Feb. 20) as well as Western Europe, Africa, and western Asia (on Feb. 21)."
A tour in YouTube shows us many different takes on the eclipse:
From Argentina, user KrrAinagotable posted this video with subtitles, explaining the process and images from his window, as well as adding some footage taken from the TV in different areas of Argentina.
From Capetown in South Africa Finn Gregory has a time lapse video showing the eclipse as seen from there.
From Mexico, user holatabasco posted a video where street noise accompanies the pinprick image of a slowly disappearing moon.
And to roundup, user pookeo1 uploaded this last video with images from different places in the world including the US, Canada, Czech Republic, Brazil and Germany.

Syria: Silence Over the "Bigger Holocaust" · Global Voices
On February 29th, Israel's Deputy Defense Minister Matan Vilnai warned of "a bigger Holocaust" for the Palestinians.
Syrian blogger Ayman, from the Damascene Blog, compares between the world's silence to that comment and the fuss made over Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's alleged call to "wipe Israel off the map."
حكومة تدعي أنها تمثل الشعب الذي عانى ويلات الهولوكوست تهدد شعباً آخر بـ"هولوكوست أكبر"، كما جاء في تصريح الوزير الإسرائيلي، والأمر -مع ذلك- لا يستحق الشجب أو الإدانة أو التعليق، حتى عندما تشرع إسرائيل بتنفيذ التهديد.
ما تعرض له الفلسطينيون من تطهير عرقي وجرائم حرب (بدءاً بالمذابح والترحيل الجماعي في 1948) وما يتعرضون له اليوم من حصار وعقوبات جماعية وقتل للمدنيين، يشبه -بلا شك- ما تعرض له اليهود خلال الحرب العالمية الثانية. وقد جرت العادة على أن يتعرض كل من يرسم هذه المقارنة للاتهام بمعاداة السامية.
The world stands and doesn't sit, when Ahmadinejad talks about wiping Israel off the map.
All the heads of states, newspapers, magazines and even the head of the United Nations comment on it and the Iranian Ambassadors in all capitals are called to hear protests.
However, when an official in the Israeli government threatens of a new Holocaust in Gaza, the issue is ignored as if it were nothing.
A government which claims it represents the people who suffered the agonies of the Holocaust is now threatening another nation of a "Bigger Holocaust" - as announced by an Israeli minister.
Despite that, it is an issue which doesn't raise a condemnation, or even a reaction, even when Israel moves on to implement its threats.
What the Palestinians are being subjected to is ethnic cleansing and war crimes, starting with the massacres and group exiles of 1948.
What they are being subjected to today in terms of border closures, sanctions and the killing of civilians, is without doubt, similar to what the Jews suffered during the Second World War.
And it has become usual for anyone drawing that comparison to be referred to as anti-Semitic.
Japan: Citizen Videos of the Earthquake · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage on the Japan Earthquake 2011.
One has to admire a person with the wits to keep a video camera turned on while the ground is shaking beneath them.
Citizen videos recorded Friday, March 11 during the earthquake and tsunami that caused mass devastation in many parts of Japan are all over YouTube.
Among the many shared online, here are just a few.
The day of the big quake
Staffers at a supermarket in Tokyo hold up the shelves during a quake that lasted longer than a minute.
As the earthquake shakes a house, the people inside rush to the street.
These people watch a tsunami engulf Iioka Port in Chiba Prefecture from higher ground.
At Shinjuku station in Tokyo, on March 11, these were people who couldn't get home after the quake.
Two days later
After the quake, a man surveyed the damage in Iioka, Chiba Prefecture on March 13th and said: "It's like the wave passed through town."

Egypt: A Lebanese in Egypt - From Occupation to Liberation · Global Voices
Layal El Katib, is a Lebanese Blogger who lived in Egypt for a while, and here are her experiences as a Lebanese living in Egypt:
I used to speak Egyptian there, in fact nobody would know I'm Lebanese unless somebody tells them, my Egyptian accent was (and still is) flawless!
So, I didn't experience any kind of problems! it was very normal and it felt like home..At school, I made great friends, we were a family, you know hanging out with the same friends everyday for several years, the bond becomes stronger than the family blood because you get to choose your friends!
I used to love the first day at school just to meet the new people!
I've always loved company and I never had a problem to blend in ANY kind of groups.
But one day, a single incident at school really affected her:
Anyways, years passed by and I'm in an Arabic period in Grade 6. I don't remember what the teacher was talking about but I remember him saying "And Of course, We all know that Lebanon is being occupied now by Israel...".
I wasn't shocked by what he said, I was shocked by the whole class's reaction!
It was nothing but a big "BOOOOOOO" accompanied by fingers pointed at me!
I can't describe how it felt!
But it was so weird and shocking that I didn't do anything but smiling!
In the very same day, during the recess, I remember bursting into tears on my best friend's shoulder!
I didn't cry because of the occupation thing, I didn't cry because the teacher said that the whole Lebanese soil was occupied and that he was wrong, I did because it was the first time I felt like a stranger, a minority or an intruder!
Then a few years later:
So I'm still in Egypt, still at the same school, same friends, same street...etc.
It's the year 2000, the year when the Zionist army finally left the Lebanese Soil (except for Shebaa farms) because of the amazing Lebanese resistance.
We went out later that day, I can't remember where.
But I remember that when we reached the apartment's door, a guy approached us and said "Mabrouk, Rafa3to Rasna" (Meaning Congrats, You honored us).
I can't describe how I felt.
It was simply amazing.
That stranger and few (1 or 2) close friends probably were the only persons who congratulated us.
My friends were happy for me when I told them about it.
It didn't bother me really that they didn't call, and it doesn't bother me even now.
We Arabs are weird!
It was still Egypt, and it was still Lebanon.
Isn't it logical for the BOO to become a YAAY?
Iran: A New Year Begins · Global Voices
Yesterday, marked the first day of spring and the Iranian New Year.
Nowruz or Norouz is celebrated in Iran and several other countries such as Tajikistan and Afghanistan.
Several bloggers celebrated the day and shared their wishes and ideas on this occasion.
Some, like Raze No (meaning "new secret") added photos of festivities and spring to their blog (as above).
1Pezeshk (meaning "one doctor" in Persian), a creative blogger, asked several bloggers to express themselves on Iranian New Year in a podcast .
Seven Iranian bloggers and one Afghan blogger answered his call, and the result was a joint podcast.
Khabgard writes with irony that the Iranian government, in the final days of last year, gave Iranians another gift: "Nine magazines were shut down!"
The blogger adds that the government has delivered so many surprises, that Iranians can no longer predict what the future holds in store for the new year, let alone tomorrow!
Falosofah writes about the difficult situation for writers and translators in Iran.
He says:
The first idea crossing the mind of writers and translators is the following: "Can I keep living at the same standard as I have in the past 10 years, or will I be forced to move to smaller cities or emigrate?
Each time a society faces political and economic troubles, the most affected people are the ones involved with culture and science.
If you talk with a publisher or a bookstore owner, they will tell you that the prices of all other goods they sell have increased enormously, while book prices, like for other cultural products, have decreased.
Azadi Barabary blog has published , a message from Kaveh Abbassian, a left wing student leader.
He says that some of his best friends are still in prison, and that students in all universities are under pressure, and freedom of speech and free association are under attack.
He adds:
Despite all the pressure we say: We are present!
We stand up!
We don't negotiate our will to defend freedom and equality.
We are stronger and more determined than ever.
Jomhour called President Ahmadinejad's message for New Year unrealistic.
The Iranian president praised economic, cultural and political achievements in last year.
The blogger says the government's mismanagement created high unemployment rates and inflation.
He says maybe we should change the meaning of the word 'achievement' in the dictionary.
Sri Lanka: Remembering Arthur C Clarke · Global Voices
The death of Arthur C. Clarke (1917 - 2008) has many people - some who are ardent enthusiasts of science fiction, and others who know of him blogging about their reflections on the man.
From a fleeting glimpse, to an incidental conversation, Clarke is remembered fondly by many Sri Lankan bloggers as a visionary and a futurist.
The British author moved to Sri Lanka in 1956 and lived there ever since.
Words of Amaruwan writes on how Clarke's works initiated a love for science fiction.
Sir Arthur is the reason I started loving science fiction.
When I was 10 years old I first got my hands on his famous short story: The Sentinel.
Ever since then I was hooked.
And I couldnt wait to get my hands on more of his work.
Which was by no means easy.
Sir Arthur was a prolific writer with more than a 100 books to his credit along with numerous essays and short stories.
Even wikipedia can only put up a partial bibliography.
What made him so appealing was that although the science in his science fiction was of the highest levels his writing was very simple, very entertaining and very powerful.
And his stories were more about the story than the science.
Gallicissa remembers meeting the author in 2002.
I arranged this meeting and was lucky enough to accompany him on this visit to meet Dr. Clarke who was at his study browsing some super-magnified pictures of the Mars in his Laptop when we met him.
Showing us those Martian pictures soon and pointing to a pale coloured straight line captured clearly in it, he asked what we think about it!
Clarke helpfully intervened with a smile ‘it looks like someone has driven a pretty large vehicle!’
LIRNEasia laments the loss of a person they closely collaborated with, shedding light on the fact that there was more to the man than writing fiction.
In November 2005, LIRNEasia had its last official encounter with him when few representatives from WorldSpace (our partner in the Last-Mile Hazinfo project) including Dr. Rangarajan met him in Colombo.
His insightful comments on the need for early warning for disasters are still being used in the output from that project.
Rants, Raves and Miscellaneous Musings remembers a brief encounter with Clarke - a delightful anecdote on playing table tennis with him.
The blogger also brings to focus a controversial episode in the author's life when a tabloid accused him of being a pedophile.
Now I'm not much of a TT player.
Hell, the main reason I played was so that some day I could tell people, Yeah, I played table tennis with Arthur C Clarke.
But this was humiliating.
A 75 year old man, who was supporting himself by holding on to the table with one hand, and not even moving from his position, beat me. he just had a massive reach, and a killer top spin that had me bouncing all over the place, while he calmly stayed there.
As a friend of mine said when I told him this: Pwnt!
Ultrabrown from India writes
None of this means that Clarke is insensitive to the minutiae of human lives, or to our deepest feelings: his beautiful, sentimental "Dog Star", about an astronaut having to part with his beloved dog when he goes to live on a lunar observatory, is about the closest any short story has come to moistening my ever-dry eyes.
(It's also one of a few examples in Clarke's work of a rational mind struggling with an experience that borders on the supernatural, and never coming completely to terms with the scientific explanation.)
The author of Moving Images, Moving People! who has worked with Clarke for about 21 years, writes wistfully about the last video message that was shot.
We had already donned him in a colourful bush shirt - and crew and I felt that this was the right attire for a message that was intensely personal and somewhat wistful.
The shirt with large prints was far more characteristic of Arthur C Clarke than any formal suit.
At that moment, I was the shoot’s director and not his long-standing spokesperson who would be more agreeable with his views and wishes.
A few tense moments passed.
Then one of Sir Arthur’s valets had a brainwave.
Why not don the casual NASA jacket that Sir Arthur often wore when he felt the air conditioning was getting a bit too cold?

The Great Wave off Kanagawa by Katsushika Hokusai
As a response to the situation in Japan after the earthquake, tsunami and nuclear crisis, people have turned to videos and music as a way to send their best wishes and support to the people of Japan.
In his blog, Tomonori Shiba gathered a few videos from musicians who believed that it was the least they could do, trusting on music's power to heal the wounds of the heart.
This first one is by micromicrophone:
Gifted on West East, located in Seattle, USA wrote a hip hop song about the disaster, urging people to commit and do their best to help.
From the song:
Post in my status, inside im careless
With a couple thousand of miles apart I feel fearless
And see its not me, and so I feel fine
Put it in the backburner have a great time
But that lacks effort with bad track record
instead of back tracking we should really act faster
And keep after, we keep praying
And start to take action instead of just saying...

Morocco: Bloggers React to Fouad Mourtada's Release From Prison · Global Voices
At 11:30 GMT, Sami Ben Gharbia broke the news that Fouad Mourtada had been freed.
Mourtada, who was sentenced on February 22 to three years in prison, was released after serving only 25 days of that sentence (he was, however, imprisoned for 43 days total).
So far, no major news sources have reported on the story, but several bloggers have reacted.
Omar El Hyani of Blog Open Source reports:
This is a huge victory for digital activism.
Thank you to all the people who supported the campaign, both online and offline!
Curt of The Committee to Protect Bloggers is on top of things, reacting quickly to Global Voices Advocacy's post:
Global Voices asserts that Fouad Mourtada has been released from prison with a “full royal pardon.”
If this is true, it’s fantastic news for Fouad.
Not great news for free speech or Morocco, though, that it took a royal pardon.
Can anyone confirm this?
At the time of this posting, no major news sources had reported on Mourtada's release.
Blogger of the Week: Abdulrahman Warsame · Global Voices
Today's Blogger of the Week series features yet another global voice - Abdulrahman Warsame, who amplifies the reactions of Somali bloggers on Global Voices Online.
A Somali born in Saudi Arabia, educated in Egypt and Australia, and currently working for Al Jazeera in Doha, Qatar, as a Senior Analyst in New Media, Warsame shares his thoughts on blogging in his country and the rest of the Arab world.
At his personal blog, Warsame, who graduated from Monash University in Australia in Information Systems, focuses on politics.
"My blog is mostly a commentary on politics, journalism and culture but certainly politics takes a bigger space.
Being an Arab and African, I focus on them most.
I'm excited when I see young Arabs and Africans using the web - among other means - to bring about positive change: Egyptian bloggers exposing police torture or Kenyan bloggers rallying together to fight tribalism and create projects like Ushahidi.com to help those who need help.
I get annoyed by the lack of time, I would like to write a lot more but I don't seem to be able to get the time.
My co-blogger Hanna Ali makes the blog tick, with her intelligent comments on politics and Africa," he says.
For Warsame, although the role between a blogger and a journalist are distinct, there are many meeting points.
"Blogging is simply a tool, so a journalist could be a blogger and so can a doctor.
Blogging is closer to activism than journalism, but bloggers sometimes do some journalism (i.e. bloggers from Myanmar, Egypt and Iraq committed acts of journalism).
But there are also journalists who blog, like Andrew Heavens," he explains.
A relatively newcomer to GVO, Warsame hopes to be able to amplify what Somali bloggers are writing about and possibly encourage more of them to blog. "I hope to introduce Somali bloggers to the readers of GVO and hopefully encourage more Somalis to read and write blogs. The Somali blogsphere is still relatively young and very diverse.
Most Somali blogs, until now, are in English and are written by young Somalis in the North America, UK, Middle East and Africa.
Forums and chat rooms are still big but as blogging catches on there would be more Somali blogs written in Somali language."
Besides blogging, Warsame devotes "a large chunk" of his spare time to reading.
"I also like photography so I do it whenever I get my hands on a decent camera (planning to buy a pro camera in the near future).
Socializing and drinking tea (at least 5+ cups a day) is another hobby."
The father of a five-month-old son, Ibrahim, is also dismayed at the lack of interest in reading among some of his Arab compatriots - and blames the 'system' for it.
"Having been through Arab schools and speaking to students and teachers here, I think the education system is largely to blame for the lack of interest in reading books (people read newspapers).
There are less books published in the Arab world (than Iran for example), there are few public libraries or national programs to encourage reading from you age.
There was no decent public library in Cairo when I lived there, and it's the same here in Qatar (though they're building one now).
It's a crisis and unfortunately no one is doing anything about it," he notes.
And are Arabs making the most of online technologies?
"Some are and some aren't.
I don't think anyone understands the dynamics yet though.
Iraqi bloggers like Riverbend and Healing Iraq have done very well and online news sites like Morocco's Hespress are very successful.
Forums and chat rooms are still bigger though.
Governments, public institutions and companies are very much behind: most of their websites are out of date and have little information about anything.
They assume people wouldn't be looking at them," says the blogger, who is fluent in Somali, Arabic and English and has a bit of Chinese (Mandarin) and Farsi under his belt.

Many of the top presidential candidates are using blogs as a way to communicate with potential voters as they transmit their thoughts about a specific topic or explain their government plan in case they are elected.
These blogs are written and published in one of Paraguay’s mains newspapers called Diario ABC.
To date, some of the candidate have more than 43,000 visits and some even 500 comments on a single post, which indicates a high degree of interest for this election.
Few would have thought that there would be such a direct communication from a presidential candidate with a potential voter, who could express an opinion or a concern, debate or even scrutinize their platform.
Two of the major candidates that each have their own blogs are:
Fernando Lugo is a Roman Catholic bishop and is running for president with the Christian Democratic Party.
He writes about what he had to do in order to run for the highest office in Paraguay .
Some additions to the Global Voices home page · Global Voices
Over the course of the four-plus years the project has been in existence, Global Voices has grown into much more than the summaries of global blog commentary which take up most of the space on our home page.
In case you haven't already noticed, we recently made a few changes to the Global Voices home page which give greater prominence and allow easier access to the various components of the project.
Our Lingua translation sites, which translate Global Voices' English-language content into over thirteen languages (and counting) are now more prominently linked from a box at the top right-hand side of the home page.
The main page for our Special Coverage sections, which attempt to aggregate the massive volume of citizen media commentary on topics like the 2007 Burmese Protests, Benazir Bhutto's assassination, Kenya's post-election crisis and, most recently, the protests in Tibet, is now linked from the navigation bar just below the Global Voices logo, and links to individual Special Coverage pages are highlighted just below the featured posts.
And last but not least, prominent links to our outreach section, Rising Voices, Global Voices Advocacy and our special US elections project Voices without Votes, are now displayed just before the short links on the right-hand side of the home page.
China: Bloggers declare war on Western media's Tibet coverage · Global Voices
Once the news of Tibetans slicing children's ears off and burning people alive sunk in, Chinese netizens worldwide seized onto initial misreported details from the situation in Tibet and don't seem willing to let this one go.
In fact, they've declared cyberwar on major western media outlets, and anti-CNN.com is campaign headquarters.
As words like Tibet and Lhasa moved to the top of the GFW keyword list following the outbreak of violence and unrest in southwestern China earlier this month, a lot of attention to root causes to the Tibet situation simply stopped at anti-CNN.com's collection of photos, screenshots, furious accusations and non-sequiturs, most of which might hold up under scrutiny, as the collection made for convenient paste-and-copy blogging.
For bloggers trapped between two sides in a ruthless propaganda battle that has seen lives lost and a large part of China placed under military lock-down, there's of course a lot of frustration being felt about how to even begin blogging the situation.
Then there are facts such as that young Tibetan militants in exile fully intended to created a disturbance in Lhasa for this year's Tibetan National Uprising Day and have talked openly about doing so for the past several months.
So how does one start addressing this now unfortunately prevalent attitude among Chinese bloggers seen in the intro on anti-CNN.com?
26th March - Bangladesh celebrates the Declaration of Independence · Global Voices
As Bangladesh celebrates its Independence Day on 26th March, the Bangla blogosphere is inundated with posts reliving the horrific Operation Searchlight that was launched by the Pakistan Army on 25th March 1971, in a desperate attempt to stamp out the Bengali Nationalist movement.
Abul Bahar brings to life that fateful the fateful night of 25 March, 1971 with the following words:
Suddenly Dhaka came to a standstill.
There was complete silence all around.
The country was shivering under the heavy tread of the evil forces.
The earth was soaked red and the fragrant smell of the hasnahana flower was overpowered with the stench of blood.
Bloggers today are vociferous about the estimated 3million people that had been exterminated during 1971.
The Bangladesh Genocide Archive has been painstakingly put together by some of the leading Bangla bloggers, to make netizens aware of the extent of atrocities committed on the Bengali population by the Pakistan Army with help from the Razakars.
Another new website to be launched by bloggers is Bangladesh 1971, which aims at connecting today’s generation of Bangladeshis with the life and times of the people who fought for the country’s Independence, while simultaneously keeping up the pressure on the Nation’s conscience to bring the perpetrators to book.
Why is it necessary today to relive the freedom struggle?
Perhaps to avoid the ‘Hollywoodization of the liberation war’ as Rasel puts it.
Also, Shamim clarifies why after so many years, it still remains imperative to bring the war criminals to trial.
He says it is not out of a feeling of retribution but rather as a future deterrent that this ‘bringing to book’ is necessary.
It is also a necessary step towards ensuring justice and a closure for the victims and their surviving families.
Rabab writes that on this day of Independence, he feels no inspiration but only a sense of hurt and dejection when he sees all around him the corruption and victory of the separatist forces, the dreams of a united and economically strong Bangladesh fading into despair.
Blogger Shobjanta seems to share in this hurt.
However, the feeling evaporates once he listens closely to the National Anthem “Amar Shonar Bangla, ami tomay bhalobashi” (my precious Bengal, I love you).
Argentina: Web Entrepreneurs in Palermo Valley · Global Voices
Photo by Santi Boy and used under a Creative Commons license.
Twitter has been one of the most talked about tools in 2007, and communites have been created around short messages or microblogging.
Many were quick to realize its usefulness or its "fashionable" status.
In spite of all of this, Twitter remains in use, with more users each day and with hundreds of thousands of messages per day.
In that community, the idea to create a network of Argentine web entrepreneurs was born.
Santiago Siri commented that it would be interesting to get together because many web 2.0 iniatives in Argentina appear to be based out of Palermo, one of the more traditional neighborhoods of Buenos Aires.

Cuba: Blocking Bloggers · Global Voices
Want to get the Cuban blogosphere talking?
Block access to a popular blog.
Ever since Cuban authorities did just that to several less-than-supportive Havana-based blogs earlier this week, the blogging diaspora have come out in full support of Cuban bloggers - especially Yoani Sanchez and her popular Generacion Y blog, which, according to this post, seems to be the principal target.
El Diario de la Resistencia II and Cuba File quote from the Reuters story:
Sanchez, whose critical Generacion Y blog received 1.2 million hits in February, said Cubans can no longer visit her Web page (http://www.desdecuba.com/generaciony/) and two other home-grown bloggers on the Web site on a server in Germany.
All they can see is a "error downloading" message.
The Cuban Triangle, however, in touch with friends in Cuba, reports that "the site was blocked, then 'a slow access' was permitted."
But this "slow access" does nothing to change the opinion of El Cafe Cubano, who compares Raul Castro's regime to apartheid:
While the media and some bloggers are praising raulita like he's some sort of saint or the catalyst for FREEDOM.
He's using the Chinese model FOLKS!
Wow computers are available now, but no one can afford them and as you can see the internet is restricted.
Blog for Cuba adds:
What will Cubans do with all those new computers?
One thing for sure, they won't be reading Cuban blogs that voice dissent.
Raul the reformer, remains Raul the Oppressor.
Blue Star Chronicles is not at all surprised, but admits to being a little confused:
Don’t the progressives (aka communist) of our country just love the current Cuban form of government.
I keep hearing how superior it is to ours.
I keep hearing how they have a better medical care system, etc.
Of course, the people who say that are almost exclusively well-to-do latte liberals who don’t have to live under the confines of a petty dictator.
I’ve not seen a one of them actually move there.
Tim Worstall echoes his sentiment in this post, while TonyTeri.com acknowledges that "it takes extreme guts for her (Sanchez) to write about what she does.
She actually has to roam about Cuba blogging from hotels and other areas with Internet access usually reserved for foreigners."
Underscoring this point is 1Click2Cuba:
Blogging in Cuba can get you in a heap of trouble (translation: jail), but that threat hasn't stopped hundreds of bloggers on the island determined to get their messages out.
Lately, Cuban bloggers have taken to dressing like tourists, feigning accents and secretly using hotel internet lines (native Cubans aren't allowed inside tourist hotels).
Once inside the hotel, Yoani Sanchez has to write fast.
Not only because she fears getting caught, but because online access is prohibitively expensive.
An hour online costs about $6, the equivalent of half of what the average Cuban make in a month.
Independent bloggers like Sanchez have to build their sites on servers outside Cuba, and they have more readers outside Cuba than inside.
Readership in fact extends to other Caribbean territories and Child of the Revolution notices that "the attempt to effectively shut down the sometimes critical blog has received wide coverage in the international media, in outlets as diverse as The Sun Sentinel and the Left-leaning London daily, The Guardian."
Jefferson Lives posts a thoughtful perspective on the situation, saying:
I have always found it fascinating that each country can have its own laws regarding something that is supposed to be the World Wide Web.
Understandably it is tough to regulate something on a global scale.
However, valuable information and potential freedoms are being violated repeatedly by restricting freedom of the press and freedom to post on a global scale.
This begs this question, in an arena without borders, is Cuba violating essential rights for citizens in the US by restricting this website for all to see, or just their citizens?
...while Uncommon Sense asks:
Looking for an easy way to stick it to the Cuban dictatorship?

Ecuador: The Aftermath of the Border Crisis · Global Voices
Picture by i-ren ishii and used under Creative Commons license.
The decision taken at the Rio Summit benefits the people living in the three countries involved: Ecuador, Colombia and Venezuela, but the governments are only slowly returning their relations back to how they were before the incident.
The Organization of American States (OAS) has already handed out its resolution and it seems Ecuadorean government is happy with this decision, and even though President Correa has personally said that crisis between these two brother countries has ended, diplomatic relationships are still on hold.
Because the Ecuadorean government thinks that Colombia is still untrustworthy.
While President Uribe says he wants peace in the region while shaking hands with Correa, the Colombian media is not backing what Uribe says.
The newspaper El Tiempo showed a picture with the supposed Ecuadorean Defense Minister and FARC's late leader Raúl Reyes.
However, it was later revealed that the other person was not the Ecuadorean official, rather a leader from an Argentine leader from the Communist Party.
This event has been widely discussed in Ecuador and the newspaper wrote an editorial apologizing for the mistake that damaged the international image of Ecuador.
Nelson Piedra the author of a blog in Southern Ecuador writes about this huge mistake:
Jordan: Five Jordanian Journalists Jailed · Global Voices
Five Jordanian journalists have been sentenced to three months in prison each, in two separate cases, for breaking the law in their country.
Jordan's bloggers speak up against this latest crackdown on freedom of expression.
According to the International Freedom of Expression Exchange, "two of Jordan's main daily newspapers, "Ad-Dustour" and "Al Arab Al Yawm", were found in contempt of the judiciary for publishing a news item about a lawsuit filed by a Jordanian against a judges' decision to deprive him of his citizenship" in the first case.
In the second, a satirical writer's article about the Higher Media Council was considered slanderous by the court.
Writing at the Black Iris of Jordan, Naseem Tarawnah asks:
When HM King Abdullah said some time ago that “the sky is the limit” when it comes to press freedoms, I don’t think this is what he had in mind.
What more can I say?
Nothing.
Mental Mayhem is outraged with the situation and writes:
I lost hope in freedom of the press in Jordan a long time ago.
I can't remember exactly when but I think it goes back to my early twenties when I first joined the ranks of repressed Jordanian journalists.
I have written about violations of press freedom on this blog many times, then I got tired of it.
Until when, really?
Things seem to be going from bad to worse.
She further adds:
Since when is reporting on a court case a crime in Jordan?
I'm baffled.
Lina Ejeilat asks the following questions too:
So it's against the law for the press to debate court rulings.
But I'm a bit confused as to what this exactly entails.
Don’t we criticize reduced sentences in so-called honor crimes all the time?
Is that against the law?
Of course, we all want to be living in a country where no one is above the law, but that doesn’t mean the law is perfect the way it is and cannot be scrutinized.
Commenting on the law or criticizing it, and abiding by it are not mutually exclusive.
Tajikistan: Politicized Navruz · Global Voices
Navruz is one of the main celebrations for Tajiks.
This time — more than ever — it means end of one of the harshest winter in several decades.
People could hardly wait for these warm days that have come with the beginning of spring.
Navruz has been celebrated throughout the country during the last six days.
Aisha saysthat it's a nice time because "Tajik people seem to gain energy after the hardships of winter":
In Tajik language Navruz means "New Day" and the 21st of March is also a kind of New Year eve.
This year, the president came to Khujand and all people were walking in the streets and parks, taking boats on the river, eating ice-cream and watching street performers.
Women wore national satin spring-colored dresses and friends and families got together to make sumanak — a sweet paste made from wheat.
During the last six days Tajik broadcast media were covering only Navruz celebrations attended by higher officials in different parts of the country.
Tojvar comments that it is too hard to see one and the same face on TV all the time :
If a foreigner watches Navruz on Tajik television, he would think that it is either a president's birthday or his pre-election campaign.
This year all main festivities were held in Khujand on the main square near the building of the local government, where a a theatrical performance of more than thousand people — including children — was held and attended by the president.
Ravshan at neweurasia is wondering why we have such big celebrations, if they are restricted by the law, which was introduced by the incumbent president :
Last year, new regulations restricting lavish festivities were introduced in Tajikistan.
Now, one year after that, a lot of money is spent for one celebration of Navruz.
What is the cost of all those costumes and decorations?
How much money was spent to take governmental officials from Dushanbe to Khujand?
Why do we have enough money to organize this kind of dubious events and don’t have money to buy give food to the starving people?
Tajikistanweb points to the contradictory statement made by president Rahmon.
In his speech to the Tajik intelligentsia on the occasion of Navruz, Rahmon criticized the Tajik mass media for late response to the events that are happening in the country:
Whenever something happens in our country, people are informed about it by the Russian agencies and only then our media air the news," said the president.
"As a result, the situation is often misunderstood, and thus - false, defamatory or exaggerated news reports emerge.
To solve this problem, he ordered to establish a news channel that would operatively inform people about happenings within the country and abroad.
At the same time, Rahmon expressed his implicit support for the state censorship, underlining the need to hinder publication of any material that offends dignity, in particular, of the officials, or incites conflicts, regionalism and extremism.
He also asked journalists to refrain from spreading "mistrust and pessimism".
The presidential wish can be interpreted into stricter censorship and further media repression by the authorities.
Any effort to contradict the official point of view can be labeled "destabilizing" by the Rahmon’s subordinates.
It's a pity that even such bright holiday as Navruz has been used by the government to brainwash the population and further restrict the media freedom.
Colombia: Contest brings forth multimedia citizen journalists · Global Voices
Showing hidden Colombia through online tools could get you inside the Googleplex, if your work wins the "Best told place in Colombia" contest.
Most of the links in this article will send you to websites in Spanish, unless otherwise noted.
Semana publications in Colombia has opened a contest along with Google for anyone, regardless of nationality, to write, show and create content telling the world about a very special place in Colombia most people wouldn´t normally be aware of, using at least two of Google's tools such as Picasa, YouTube, Google Maps, Google Earth, SketchUp, Page Creator and or Panoramio, and documenting their research and progress through a blogger blog.
For awarding prizes, several aspects will be taken into account by the judges: quality of the content, creativity of the author or authors, the story´s relevance, development of the work done and adequate usage of the included tools, the use of different web resources and the interest and comments from users.
The full instructions and information on the contest are available (in Spanish), at Colombia En El Mapa website.
One of the nice touches are that although the prize is a visit to the Googleplex in California, where the winner will get to meet the developers of the tools used, they have taken into account the immense difficulty that is for a Colombian,and many other, citizen to get a US visa.
So if the winner doesn´t have a valid US visa, they will fly them instead to the Google offices in Argentina, a country for which Colombian citizens don´t need a visa to enter.
Colombia, the only risk is wanting to stay photo by *L*u*z*a*
He takes it on his hands to record the other aspects of Chocó, the scenery, the places, stories and people.
Another participating blog is Victor Solano's who wrote one telling the story of Rising Voices' project, Hiperbarrio at La Loma de San Javier, in Medellín, Colombia.

Myanmar: Photos of Earthquake Disaster · Global Voices
A 6.8 earthquake hit northeast Myanmar on the evening of Thursday 24 March, 2011, which was felt in nearby Thailand and as far away as Vietnam and China.
The quake killed at least 70 people and destroyed more than 240 buildings in Myanmar alone.
Strong tremors were also recorded in the cities of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai in Thailand.
The number of casualties could be higher.
According to reports, more than 80 coffins were sold out in Tachilek on the morning of Friday 25 March.
Observers described the earthquake as the third biggest natural disaster that struck Burma after the 2008 Cyclone Nargis and the 2010 Cyclone Giri.
Independent paper The Irrawaddy interviews residents of Mae Sai in Thailand.
In a letter published by Shan Herald, Jai Noi narrated the impact of the quake on residents

Qatar: A World Cup in the Clouds · Global Voices
A report of a remote-controlled, solar-powered hovering shade, which could be used to cool soccer stadiums in Qatar, has taken on a life of its own, putting the small but wealthy Gulf nation in the spotlight once again.
Almost a week ago, The Peninsula newspaper wrote a brief, three paragraph article describing research at Qatar University for an "artificial cloud", attributing the story to an Arabic newspaper.
Qatar University's "artificial cloud" stadium.
Image from Qatar University.
Two days later, the story made it onto the BBC Sports page, this time including an animation of the robotic "cloud" from Qatar University.
And then the next day, it was on CNN:
And by now, it's had a run in Time, NBC Sports, Fast Company, Bldg Blog, the Daily Mail, Engadget, and io9, to name a few.
Perhaps the most amusing - and most retweeted - take on the story though, was by Yahoo!
Sports: Qatar stole its artificial cloud idea from television cartoon The Simpsons.
In the legendary two-part 1995 episode entitled "Who Shot Mr. Burns?" nefarious power plant owner C. Montgomery Burns devises a plan to create a giant shield that will block the sun and keep Springfield in perpetual darkness:
Still from The Simpsons cartoon television show.
Their claim that "while Qatar may have added their own twist ... the core idea is clearly ripped from a 16-year-old cartoon", even illicited a response from a former Simpsons show writer:
@thatbilloakley: Qatar better be paying me residuals on this idea: http://yhoo.it/g1EcMo
In its many iterations and reprints, the World Cup "cloud" story has garnered thousands of tweets.
@sgmansfield: Qatar to make man made clouds for the 2022 World Cup... anyone ever heard of sunblock? http://bit.ly/ghd2Ur
@staffordmasie: Nice!
Qatar University to create artificial robotic cloud; potentially drop temps significantly on World Cup pitches http://t.co/RnleHP9
@mabdrabbo: Robot Cloud for Qatar 2022 WC ?
Cool !
What about the noise of it ? http://bit.ly/dLRoKK #qatar #worldcup #2022 #football
Some joked:
@digitalcastro: Cloud Over Qatar Stadium ;) Great Idea http://twitpic.com/4dohml
@hmalsabah: Is this the Qatar Cloud taking over #kuwait? :p http://plixi.com/p/86752846
Others, however, have expressed exasperation at the seemingly endless life of this thinly-sourced story:
@DavidQatar: @james_Corbett this cloud story is spreading like wildfire-no connection at all to Q2022 - one prof at qatar uni muses on his research..boom
@dohanews: Is the Qatar World Cup artificial cloud story going to circulate on Twitter forever and ever??
Whether or not this US $500,000 construction will be gracing the stadia of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar though, remains to be seen.
Albanian Activists Rally Against a 'Concrete' End for Tirana's Last Public Park · Global Voices
Citizens trying to stop a cement mixer truck.

Activists in Albania are continuing to protest against plans to build a children's play area in the last public park in the capital Tirana.
Opponents of the construction say the project will drown the green space — something that's already lacking in the city — in concrete.
Tirana's Mayor Erion Veliaj disputes this.
Responding to demands for transparency, Veliaj posted some videos on his Facebook profile, retorting that new construction will not use concrete, but sand and plastics only.
The mayor's office says the project is necessary because the city's haphazard development has left children without many play areas.
Protesters argue that poor planning is no excuse to strip residents of the park and accuse the local government of breaking several laws on public and environmental consulting in the process.
In fact, the National Agency of the Environment officially confirmed that it has not received any application from the municipality for the proper environmental permit required by law.
The citizen-led challenge to the construction project has been met with hostility from local government officials, who labelled protesters as instruments of the opposition Democratic Party and "vandals".
The issue has received scant media coverage, despite the fact that police used force to disperse demonstrations and arrested 12 participants on February 21.
"The trees are air!"
Photo by "Qytetaret Per Parkun" (Citizens for the Park), used with permission.
The need for transparency
After the protests erupted, the mayor's office began a push to publicize aspects of the project, but construction opponents don't think it's enough.
For example, the project plan itself has not been published, despite requests from the movements "Per Publiken" (For Public) and "Qytetaret Per Parkun" (Citizens for the Park).
Veliaj invited the protesters and other civil society activists to attend public hearings, asking them to monitor the process and see for themselves that no tree would be cut down, but they refused as long as the project plan wasn't public, and while the controversial work was already underway.
On March 16, protesters went to check on the park after seeing large concrete trucks enter the area.
They say they discovered channels filled with gravel and concrete as well as stumps of cut trees within the park, the opposite of what the mayor's promises.
Protesters march to the park and occupy an area within the park
Citizens escalated their protests in response.
That night, they began a permanent sit-in protest, occupying the area.
On March 19, activists organized another protest, including a march from the Tirana City Hall to Tirana Lake Park.
"Stop the arrogance!
Against paving with concrete!"
Photo by "Qytetaret Per Parkun" (Citizens for the Park), used with permission.
Citizens showed up in the hundreds, though there appeared to be more police presence than protesters.
When participants arrived at the park, police prevented them from entering the fenced area.
"Against paving with concrete!"
Photo by "Qytetaret Per Parkun" (Citizens for the Park), used with permission.
Some protesters attempted to block the cement mixer trucks from entering the park, but police posted to guard the designated area have frustrated their efforts.
Activists put out the call on social media to take "Aksion anti beton" (Action against concrete), while the the police denied access to media that tried to record the events (as seen in the video below):
'Met with outright arrogance'
The anti-construction movements have also tried legal action to stop the play area project.
They filed a legal complaint against the municipality of Tirana, accusing them of breaking the law, but have received no answer from the general prosecutors office so far.
They are now preparing to sue the municipality in the administrative court for procedural infringement.
Media boycott: during the protest media present at the scene put their cameras down.
Photo by “Qytetaret Per Parkun” (Citizens for the Park), used with permission.
Activists' latest move was to send an open letter to the European Union (EU) Delegation in Tirana.
As a candidate for EU membership, Albania is is monitored by certain EU bodies.
And according to a 2015 survey by Albanian think tank IDM, Albanians have more faith in the EU institutions than their national ones because of widespread corruption.
The letter lists some of the citizens' grievances:
It is disconcerting that project has already started being implemented by the Tirana Municipality – in contravention to procedural standards and safeguards in place.
In particular, the project has been initiated despite the lacking pertinent construction, environmental and archaeological permits.
Furthermore, the project has not been subjected to construction supervision, which is to be carried out by a third party.
The project has been given a start notwithstanding the fact that there has been no approval of a Master Plan of the Lake Park.
Most importantly, the project was initiated without due informing and consulting of the public and stakeholders: the project has never been published and the public has not been made available neither a detailed project as a whole or even in part as a simple outline.
In light of the unfolding situation, we would like to kindly draw your attention to the fact that the voice and perspective raised by numerous civic movements has met with outright arrogance by the Tirana Municipality authorities, despite the fact that these very authorities have infringed standards and obligations from the legislative and regulatory framework in place
Another concern of the protesters, which is noted in the letter, is Albanian environmental NGOs, which have refrained from taking legal action, though several issued a joint declaration against the project and posted it to one of their websites.
Protesters say their timidity is due to their partial dependency on government funds as well as fear of intimidation.

Trinidad & Tobago: The Laptop Incident · Global Voices
Trinidad and Tobago's Opposition Leader was recently suspended from Parliament for using his laptop without permission, but only a few bloggers seemed tuned in to the story...
Trinidad and Tobago Computer Society posted a comprehensive roundup of mainstream media stories about the event, and as expected, The Extra Secret Blog of Basdeo Panday, which came into being during Trinidad and Tobago's recently-held general elections as a response to this popular blog, was quick on the draw in defending "himself":
I hope you all see what I go through for you.
I had to go through a terrible ordeal in Parliament.
The PNM set up the whole thing to make me look bad.
They had speaker Barry Sinanan first chastise Gary Hunt for using his laptop.
The point was to make it look as though nobody can use a laptop basically, so when I went about my merry way online they wanted to rest it on me like Akon did to Danah Alleyne in Zen when she went for “ice cream” that time.
In posting his weekly roundup, Notes from Port of Spain reported that:
The House of Representatives went into meltdown when the opposition leader was suspended for using a laptop, which the government had kindly provided.
As a result, parliamentary debate on food prices, which have risen 19 per cent in the last year, was abandoned.
KnowProSE.com summed up the whole affair by saying:
This, friends, seems more of a 'I can urinate further than you' contest and is probably the best example of how Trinidad and Tobago government simply doesn't work.
Where the focus should be on actual issues, though, this has suddenly become about Panday's laptop.
Technology, while useful, has its place - and while the Speaker does seem a little too much of a Luddite by what is printed in the Trinidad Express, the grandstanding of Panday doesn't make Panday's case much better.
What was he doing that was so important on the laptop?
Was he working on the crime problem?
Digging in on the local elections issue?
And was this policy even discussed with the Speaker?
...while the whole thing has left Caribbean Free Radio feeling "terribly confused" - so much so that she has created an online poll to help her make sense of the whole unsettling incident.
Jordan: Royal Debut on YouTube · Global Voices
Queen Rania of Jordan joins the ranks of YouTubers, much to to delight of Jordanian bloggers and vloggers around the Middle East.
In a bid to break the stereotype, and engage in an international conversation, the video surfaced on YouTube yesterday with the following message:
Queen Rania is launching her presence on YouTube with this exclusive video.
There is a whole world of wonder out there that we cannot appreciate with stereotypes.
So it is important for all of us to join forces, come together and try to bring down those misconceptions.
And I have been surprised by some of the questions I have been asked about the Arab world and the Middle East.
Do all Arabs hate Americans?
Can Arab women work?
Are there any YouTubers in Jordan?
According to Queen Rania's personal page:
Queen Rania has launched an official YouTube page, with an exclusive message on the importance of cross-cultural dialogue in breaking down stereotypes.You can visit Her Majesty's page at http://youtube.com/QueenRania.
In the video, Queen Rania extends an invitation to vloggers to send her some of the misconceptions about the Arab world and says:
From now until August the 12th, which is International Youth Day, I hope to be receiving from YouTubers some of the questions that they have and some of the common stereotypes that they hear about the Arab world and I will try to break them down one by one and address them.
I will also be encouraging YouTubers to help me out and address some of these stereotypes so I will be relying on your skills and creativity so that we can all get this right.
Naseem Tarawnah is excited about the royal vlogger and writes:
It seems like a long time ago that I once wondered if HM Queen Rania was a blogger.
It seems lately, she’s gone a step forward and become a Vlogger
I think it’s a pretty good initiative (me wishing I had thought of it first), and it’s one of those Web 2.0 projects that I don’t think has ever been done on this scale and in this context.
In any case, the comments will be even more interesting to read, be they positive, negative or insulting.
Thus is the free and wacky world we call the Internet.
However, it will also be interesting how the responses take shape.
Remember, this is about Arab stereotypes, and Arabs differ in culture, politics, economics and even religious standards; having the Queen of Jordan address these questions with a broad brush may be tricky.
Another tricky territory will be maneuvering through the religious questions being posed, a territory I firmly believe the Queen should not be entering due to past misunderstandings.
I wonder however if this will be a one-time thing or if it we’ll be seeing more of the Queen’s video blogging on YouTube.
I also wonder if HM King Abdullah will also follow in these footsteps, even though I think that particularly would be a pretty bad idea for all the obvious reasons.
Khobbeizah, who also links to the video, leaves a simple message.
He says:
Queen Rania is launching her presence on YouTube with this exclusive video.
Let's participate!
Fellow Jordanian Hani Obaid comments on the post saying:
To tell you the truth, I thought this was some kind of joke like the Facebook accounts created for the royal family, but then I watched the video, and I was pleasantly surprised.
This is wonderful.
So far the page has garnered 72 comments and counting.
Lebanon: Presidential Election and Foreign Intervention · Global Voices
Lebanon is now in its fifth month without a president.
The chairman of the parliament has postponed the election date for the 15th time so far.
In Lebanon, the parliament, which is made up of 128 elected representatives, should meet to elect the president of the republic.
This has not happened yet.
The chairman of the parliament has declared that the government is unconstitutional and can not be present at any parliamentary assembly.
The government, appointed by the president, as the constitution stipulates, was made up of 30 ministers who represented most of the political groups.
Five ministers from the opposition resigned months ago but their resignations have not yet been officially accepted.
These, in addition to the assassination of Minister Pierre Gemayel, rendered the government short of its original political representation. The prime minister has refused to acknowledge the calls by the opposition to resign and has declared that he will do so only when a new president is elected.
With both the opposition and the government being supported by opposing regional and international powers, no solution seems possible until these powers agree to a solution or a compromise.
Political bickering between different parties has reached dangerous levels to the extent that there is a genuine fear of civil strife among people - especially since street fights are breaking out every now and then between supporters of various groups.
Two bloggers have written about the foreign intervention and influence on the presidential election:
In the Middle of the East writes about the visit of Samir Geagea, the president of the Lebanese Forces Party, to the United States and sees that he may be the White House’s new choice for a Lebanese president:
Samir Geagea, leader of the extreme rightwing christian Lebanese Forces, convicted for 4 separate assassinations including a Lebanese prime minister and rival christian leader Danny Chamoun, whose entire family was wiped out with him, is a man with probably more assassinations and war crimes on his conscience than anybody else in this country where war criminals are not exactly lacking.
Yet when he visited the ‘you’re either with us or with the terrorists’ crew at the White House, he was warmly received by everybody on the Middle Eastern department there, all the way up to Rice.
One man’s terrorist seems to be another man’s freedom fighter indeed. Franklin Lamb makes a lot of this visit (here on Counterpunch), and implies that Geagea might be the White House’s new favorite for the presidential post.
Jeha’s Nail worries at the sight of the Lebanese politicians going out of the country to get support for their political pursuit from regional and international powers.
A support that will make them pawns in the regional chess game:
It is a worrying spectacle to see our local politicians travel the globe, scurrying around to meet the great and (not so) good of the world, and earn their support.
The worry has to do with our country's current dynamics...
In normal countries, all this travelling and visiting is carried out “in house”.
In their quest to reach ultimate “Alpha Male” status, politicians jaw-jaw with local power-brokers, shake a few hands, talk up some ravenous crowds into frenzies of support, or smooch a few uncooperative babies.
In Lebanon, their traveling and visiting is carried out “extra muro”.
In their quest to reach ultimate “Alpha Male” status, Lebanese politicians jaw-jaw with regional power-brokers, kiss a few hands (or worse), bribe some local ravenous crowds into frenzies of support, or display a few dead babies.
In the absence of a stabilizing effect of the state, someone has to pay to maintain the country’s internal power equilibrium.
Yet, since the Zombies of the “Inner Parties” have little value economically, the “Proles” cannot afford to fund such social parasitism.
So the support can only be external, and each leader has to find patrons to support this political addiction.
To a certain extent, all our politicians become pawns in the regional chess game.
They can at best try to be opportunistic.
China: Vlogger helped Child Labor back to School · Global Voices
Xu Alun, a middle-aged vlogger hammering away at a point that "truth is power", published a series of self-made shocking videos in Ku6.com, a popular video sharing website in China.
Through a 3-episode continuous coverage, Alun exposed a moving story of three child coal haulers in Biji, a small city in the south, and with an effective online advocacy of QQ groups organized by Guo Jun, the story tended to circulate immediately among the netizens, arousing great public concern.(Click here to watch the video with English subtitles)
(The first "Child Coal hauler" video Alun published on February 10)
Almost half a million people have clicked on Alun's videos since he released his first work on the child coal haulers in February.
Cooperated with Ku6.com, the netizens began to make a donation for the three children in order to help them back to school, and finally, under the increasing pressure from the Internet advocacy, the local government decided to engage in the aid program, which further promoted the cause.
Vlogger Alun, the originator of the whole activity, eyewitnessed the process of the government aid and published another two relevant videos in his blog.
"It's really beyond my anticipation, I never thought there would be so many warm-hearted netizens supporting me," Alun said, "in the beginning, I only wanted to spread the story via Internet."
"I think as a citizen of the People's Republic of China, it is our responsibility and obligation to expose the negative phenomena in the society."
According to another active participant of the cause, Xu Alun is a 40-year old businessman who used to work in the media more than 10 years and has a studio of his own where his documentary videos are made.
He is optimistic about the outlook of citizen media which work depending on blog, BBS and instant messaging program in China, including his video blog advocacy.
The two QQ groups which had played an essential role in the cause kept encouraging their new members to widely propagate the aid program for the child labor and their close connection with the videos' author helped them become an information center where people may get the latest news about the child haulers.
However, the online action was not an all smooth sailing amid Chinese deficient confidence in Internet.
"In fact, we were all under great pressure.
A lot of people were watching us and had their own ideas about what we did," said Guo Jun, the one who created the first QQ group for Alun's video blog advocacy, "some people said we were just a bunch of idiots and only talked without actions and someone thought this was a fraud."
"Whenever I felt exhausted, I would watch the videos.
The children's sufferings made me carry on."

India: The Last Handwritten Newspaper in the World · Global Voices
The earliest forms of newspaper were handwritten and now 'The Musalman' probably is the last handwritten newspaper in the world.
This Urdu language newspaper was established in 1927 by Chenab Syed Asmadullah Sahi and has been published daily in the Chennai city of India ever since.
It is presently run by Syed Asmadullah's grand son Syed Arifullah and six skilled calligraphers work on this four pages newspaper everyday.
With a circulation of approximately 23,000 the paper covers news in Urdu language across a wide spectrum including politics, culture and sports.
With the recent technological advances, where paper newspapers are going extinct because people read them online, this personable touch is rare to find.
The price of this paper is 75 Paise (approximately 2 US cents).
Signboard of the office.
Screenshot from the video The Musalman
MadanMohan Tarun reports:
Presently it is edited by Mr. Syed Arifullah.
He took over the charge after his father died.
His father ran this paper for 40 years.
It was founded by his grandfather in 1927.
This paper has maintained its original look and had not compromised with the Urdu computer font.
Preparation of its every page takes about three hours.
After the news is received in English from its part time reporters, it is translated into Urdu and Katibs – writers, dedicated to the ancient art of Urdu calligraphy, pen – down the whole story on paper.
After that negative copy of the entire hand –written paper is prepared and pressed on printing plates.
Afsar Shaheen comments in a post of Luthfispace elaborating why lithography is still being adopted:
Urdu type setting was very difficult; also, typeset work looked ugly in comparison to handwritten work.
Therefore, Urdu resorted to lithography while other languages adopted typeset.
With the advent of computer, Urdu writing got great boost.
It allowed calligraphic writing without the problems of lithography.
Yet, a book or newspaper written by a good katib and properly lithographed is very pleasing and beautiful; computer written Urdu is no match.

Côte d'Ivoire: Who is in Control of RTI State Television? · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Côte d'Ivoire Unrest 2011.
Confusion surrounds the question of who is currently in control of the Radio Télévision Ivoirienne (RTI), the Ivorian national television station.
On March 31, the Republican Forces (FRCI) rebels loyal to Internationally recognised president Alassane Ouattara entered Abidjan, the main city of Côte d'Ivoire.
When they reached the RTI's headquarters they were faced with resistance from Gagbo's Defense and Security Forces (FDS).
The national television station is mockingly referred to as "Propaganda TV" or "LMP TV" because of the preconception that it favors President Laurent Gbagbo, who denies he lost an election in December 2010 and refuses to step down.
RTI has become the stage for a war of control.
The signal was first cut for 24 hours, and on April 1, 2011 Directscoop, a citizen information blog focused on Africa, announced that the signal of the channel was back:
Bulgaria: What Can Force a Minister to Resign? · Global Voices
On March 18, Ivan Ivanov, deputy director of Bulgaria's special division for combating organized crime (GDBOP), was arrested on charges of corruption and contacts with organized crime groups.
The affair flaired up following a hearing of the former GDBOP director Vanyo Tanov before the parliamentary Commission of Internal security and Public Order.
In the course of the hearing it emerged that the minister of the interior Rumen Petkov had also had “unregulated meetings” with alleged members of criminal groups.
Minister Petkov dismissed Tanov’s statements as “a bunch of lies.”
Later on it became clear, however, that such meetings had indeed taken place.
The inadequate and rude behavior of the minister of the interior at a news conference on March 19 caused widespread indignation.
The national TV stations did not air the outrageous footage from the news conference, but it was uploaded on YouTube.com by a journalist who had attended the event.
It was also published on Ivan Bedrov’s blog.
The renowned journalist and blogger Bedrov wonders (BUL) whether the minister could have been “high” at the conference.
The public was shocked by the disclosures.
Calls on the minister to resign spread on the internet, but for the time being he refuses to tender his resignation.
In this relation, Yovko Lambrev asks (BUL) what else has to happen in the Ministry of Interior and in Bulgaria before we “start kicking out the bad eggs, bad cops and bad governments where they belong …over the board…”
Julian Popov writes (BUL):
One could start a funny business in this country.
One could open offices and start taking bets whether Rumen Petkov will go or stay.
Whether he will be sacked or not.
Whether he will be transfered to a new job or not.
Or one could take bets on what is still to happen will actually happen.
In a week, month, six months or a year?
It is clear to everybody that Rumen Petkov is a grave liability both in the balances of his cabinet and his party .
However, it is exciting to place bets on when something which is obvious to everybody will become a real denouement.
When he actually resigns, work on the definition of a "Petkov quotient" could start.
This quotient will measure the time taken to admit in public a truth that is obvious to everybody.
Peyo Popov writes (BUL):
Lately I’ve been feeling like my days are empty if there weren’t a recorded news conference of Rumen Petkov.
When I am lucky I watch and laugh in frenzy at taglines like “your bloodthirstiness does not inspire me.”
But it is not the vulgarity of the minister that amazes me.”
The blogger admits there is a question he cannot figure out for himself:
What has to happen so that we could see a minister tender his resignation?
This difficult question, still unanswered, inspired Peyo to launch (BUL) a literary contest in the hope that “there should exist in Bulgaria a mind capable in their ingenuity to perceive a series of … events (leading to such a resignation), should it not?”
The participants in the contest are required to write a short story, describing events leading to a minister tendering his/her resignation and to send the text file or a link to the story.
The blogger is fundraising for an award for the winner in the contest.
It may seem incredible, but numerous bloggers have already contributed to the award fund and the renowned local blogger Bogomil Shopov has promised that he will make a movie based on the winning story.
Nineteen short stories have already been submitted and more are likely to come before the deadline on April 8, while the public is discussing who the winner will be and whether some of the scenarios could come true.
Greece: Public Suicide of 77 Year Old Man in Athens Square · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis. All Greece was shocked this morning by the news that Dimitris Christoulas, aged 77, shot himself in the head around 9 am, in full view of passersby in Syntagma square, Athens, across from the Parliament building.
The man is reported to have been a retired pharmacist, who sold his pharmacy in 1994.
Before the shot, he reportedly shouted that he "didn't want to leave any debts to his children".
A Facebook event calls for a gathering to Syntagma square today evening: "Everyone at Syntagma.
Let's not get used to death".
Global Voices author Asteris Masouras has made a collection of posts and media on Storify.
Poster from a Facebook event for this evening in Syntagma square. It reads: "It wasn't a suicide.
It was a murder.
LET'S NOT GET USED TO DEATH."
Greek Twitter has been buzzing all day with mixed comments and reactions on this tragic event:
@YanniKouts: Suicide of a 77-year old man this morning in Syntagma Sq shocks #Greece.
"It's the only way for a dignified end, I can't eat from garbage".
User Arkoudos makes a wish for all those left behind :
@SaraFirth_RT: Europes methods for 'saving Greece' are now literally killing the Greek people.
The syntagma suicide should never have happened #greece
Athens News reports about a suicide note found on the victim, where reportedly he compared the present Greek government to wartime collaborationists:
The Tsolakoglou government has annihilated all traces for my survival.
And since I cannot find justice, I cannot find another means to react besides putting a decent end , before I start searching the garbage for food.
Georgios Tsolakoglou was a Greek military officer who became the first prime minister of the Greek collaborationist government during the Axis Occupation in 1941-1942.
The reference is obviously seen as a comparison between the wartime government and the current government of Lucas Papademos.
User PenelopeD10, mocking Athens Mayor Giorgos Kaminis for his decision last summer to oust tents protesters off Syntagma square, because it was a bad image for Athens tourists, says ironically :
@dianalizia: shameless! karatzaferis opportunistically uses man's suicide this morning to criticize corrupt politicians & system (he is a part of)
Colombia: bloggers gathering signatures for copyright and industrial property letter · Global Voices
CC on Orange by yamaboboboCarolina Botero, lawyer and Creative Commons promoter in Colombia has been asking bloggers and anyone else with computer access and an interest in what are popularly called "intellectual property rights" to sign an open letter which will be sent to CONPES, the National Council for Social and Economic Politics, to counter a bill the DNP (National Planning Department) previously sent to them, where the new models of sharing knowledge that provide alternatives to the traditional "protection and enforcement" policies were completely ignored.

Argentina: high school students use online video to report their issues. · Global Voices
For a... decent school By uploading a video on YouTube, argentinean high school students managed to get mass media's attention to their plight: the need for a building where they can receive classes.
Currently the Ipem 112 “César Iñíguez Montenegro”, in Sebastián Elcano, a village to the north of the Cordoba capital in Argentina are receiving lessons at an elementary school.
However, because the elementary school has double shifts, the high school students are forced to receive evening classes, as if it were a night school.
Uzbekistan: Blogging fosters freedom of speech · Global Voices
Recently, the U.S. State Department has ranked Uzbekistan among "top ten" of the most authoritarian countries in the world.
During almost two decades of his reign, president I. Karimov and his clan have taken control of all spheres of life in the country – political, economic and social.
Civil society, which emerged and was developing in the country after the collapse of Soviet Union, has felt the severe pressure of Karimov's regime, especially after the Andijon events in 2005 that resulted in international sanctions on Uzbekistan.
The state has full power over mainstream media in the country.
Even though Karimov glorifies democratic values in his public speeches, there is no freedom of speech in the country.
However, today, voices are breaking through via new media – blogs.
One of such cyber-activists is Gerchik, discussing sociopolitical problems in the country in his blog.
In his most recent post, Gerchik writes about the reasons why people may leave Uzbekistan and lists vital social problems that his community is suffering from :
1.
Electricity cut-offs in the cities for two and more weeks, even on holidays.
Reason: disorganized work of the State Electricity Department staff, which collects payment for electricity. Moreover, they take bribes by "rewinding" the electricity meter back.
2.
Electricity supply is limited to 4 hours a day in rural areas;
3.
There is a great shortage of natural gas in public use, despite the fact that we the country is rich in natural gas;
4.
An average Uzbek can't feed family doing his job in Uzbekistan, so people are forced to become migrant workers;
5.
An average Uzbek family is not able to pay for utilities;
6.
The state officials are impudent enough to publicly lie that an average Uzbek citizen earns 200 USD per month;
7.
And these state officials are re-elected to the third term!
The post, which reflects reality in most parts of Uzbekistan, has generated lots of comments from other people, who suffer from the same problems.
One such comment reads :
I live in the suburb of Tashkent .
Cuts of hot water and gas were regular during the whole winter.
Electricity was cuting off repeatedly during a day… My parents live in Syrdarya.
They didn't have gas for the whole winter.
Even now its supply is very low.
People don't have access to drinking water in their houses and are to go a long way round for it.
In another post, Gerchik opines on the politics in Uzbekistan and asks readers a question that was raised by one of his friends, who apparently tried to justify the current regime's actions :
Imagine a situation: you have been making your way up in your career for very long time.
Finally, you become a president.
What will you do?
Will you try to make your life better by gaining enormous fortunes and taking your nation's wealth – big luxurious houses, top brand cars, yacht, house on the seashore and big businesses – or, will you try to change the situation in the country for the better by spending all the money for, say, development of education in the country?
This post provoked a heated discussion among readers.
Each of them gave their own view on the situation.
It is hard to answer this question.
Why?
First, I will never become a president.
Second, the problem is not only in the president.
But if I became a president, I would first take care of myself.
Who would do the opposite?
I guess no one.
Khorezm writes about the recent rally of several hundreds of women in the center of Urgench.
They were complaining about relocation of the city market to the suburbs and about the distribution of sales outlets on a new place.
As Khoresm reports, the protesters wanted a dialogue with the governor.
However, when they approached Hokimiyat they were stopped by a chain of policemen :
The crowd was stopped by a chain of Special Squad… Even though women had no arms, the policemen were wearing helmets and body armours… As a result, the crowd jamme up the traffic… The atmosphere was tense.
A rumor that the policemen had allegedly beat up one of the demonstrators made the situation worse… There was a mobile headquarters of Special Squad nearby, which, if the situation went worse, could give orders for more drastic measures… However, police managed to split the protesters into groups and finally disperse the crowd by the noon… Demonstrators decided to address their problem to the local TV channels or to RFE/RL reporters.

Macedonia: Bloggers Discuss NATO Summit and Greece · Global Voices
Last week, the Macedonian blogosphere buzzed about Greece's obstruction of Macedonia's NATO entry.
This post presents a set of typical initial reactions to this news.
Filip Petrovski described (MKD) the atmosphere in Macedonia several days before the NATO Summit:
The tension in the air is incredible.
The upcoming NATO Summit in Bucharest created a heavy atmosphere of expectation in the region.
It is absolutely impossible to predict what will happen there.
Expecting closure is already unavoidable part of our lives, of all everyday discussions...
I recently observed two friends who had different opinions about Macedonia's stance on the latest proposal by the mediator Nimetz.
I've known these two persons for a while, and I have never seen them being nervous, aggressive or intolerant of each other on political or historical issues.
But this time it wasn't so.
One of them simply got up and left in the middle of the discussion.
On the night of April 2, upon learning that Greece would stop NATO from reaching a consensus on invitation of new members, dozens of Macedonian bloggers reacted with angry posts.
Some placed pictures of the current Macedonian flag on their sites, while others chose to display (MKD) Macedonia's 1992-1995 flag, which carried the Vergina Sun symbol and is no longer in use due to Greek objections.
Many, including Toast Government (MKD), expressed an opinion that the goal of Greece is to completely negate the Macedonian identity and eradicate the nation.
Along with congratulations to Croatia and Albania (MKD), the countries that succeeded in receiving NATO invitations, some bloggers recommended (MKD) that Macedonians unite in the time of a calamity and offered ideas (MKD) to the Macedonian government on how to act in the future.
The next day, there seemed to be more optimism in bloggers' responses; some included video clips with Macedonian music in their posts.
One blogger wrote (MKD) that this was not the "end of the world":
Since morning, people around me seem possessed by some kind of madness or hysteria.
They come and go out of my office, and I hear wailing, sighs, conversations about NATO, VETO ...
I see higher spirits on the blogs, but they seem to slide into it, too.
Oh, what shall we do, too bad for our youth, loads of such stuff...
Hey, people! You were not this scared when the war started in 2001!
Come on, let's all cry out to heaven and wait for the judgment day.
As far as I can see, the Sun rose up again, my house is still in the same place, and the work I have to do is still waiting for me!!!
Zoriv commented (MKD) ironically on the Greek attempts to monopolize the world's historical heritage, saying that the true heir of Alexander the Great would not show fear that "his country could be invaded by a nation which is five times smaller."
Anti and Bi (MKD), bloggers who have been promoting principled pacifism for years and advocated Macedonia's non-involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan, reiterated their stance against participation in military alliances.
Kalina reacted (MKD) to the new breed of skepticism towards NATO and EU integration, pointing out that after the failure at the NATO Summit, some inconsistent analysts, who have never before questioned this long-term strategic objective of the country, started talking that maybe Macedonia should give up trying to gain membership in these international institutions.
Human rights experts Mirjana Najcevska and Zharko Trajanoski (MKD), held the government accountable for failing to fulfill its obligation to provide NATO membership for Macedonia. The latter warned that the huge obstructive force of Greece could not be the sole excuse for all Macedonian failures.
Bazhdardzhijata criticized (MKD) the Macedonian journalists who protested by leaving the press conference of Greek Minister of Foreign Affairs in Bucharest:
I still can't get over the prideful stupidity of these journalists.
Instead of staying at the event and bombarding with revealing questions, which would have caught the Greek fascist policies with their pants down, they decided to leave.
And the way they left! They did not make any noise, they just turned their backs on them.
After such a departure, I am sure Dora sincerely and silently thanked them.
In the following days, some Macedonian bloggers realized how important it was to communicate about these issue with the world and started publishing more English-language posts.
VBB used historical examples to emphasize that Greek arguments were unsustainable:
There's an island called Ireland.
Because of historical reasons similar to those described above, that geographical region became divided between the Republic of Ireland (an independent state like the Republic of Macedonia) and Northern Ireland, a constituent unit of another country- the United Kingdom (similar case as the Greek province of Macedonia).
The British crown has imposed harsh measures on its Irish possesions, that also included colonising loyalist elements from Great Britain.
Basically its the same story as with Greece.
However, the difference is that, today the UK does not demand from the Republic of Ireland to change its constitutional name.
Taking into account the role that politics plays in Macedonia's daily life, it is quite possible that NATO integration will remain one of the hottest political subjects for Macedonian bloggers in the near future.
Afghanistan: First blogging workshop in Kabul · Global Voices
The Afghan Association of Blog Writers (Afghan Penlog) overcame financial difficulty and obstacles like electricity shortages to organize the first blogging workshop in their history.
The workshop was held in Kabul on April 3-4, in association with Nasim Fekrat and Masoumeh Ebrahimi , two active Afghan bloggers.
Twelve journalists, teachers and writers learned how to start a text blog, a video blog, a photo blog, and useful tips, like how to use RSS feeds.
At the end of the workshop, several blogs were created in Dari, Pashtou and English. Fekrat said, "I am receiving lots of inquiries from Kabul University students and journalists who want to learn blogging, but financial problems remain a main obstacle."
Fekrat is already thinking of organizing a second workshop because there is more to share and teach.
Nasim Fekrat helps lead the workshop.
Nasim Fekrat says :
This experience has been very useful.
I learned a lot.
Most of the people who participated in this workshop were journalists, academics, writers and others who can help revitalize our culture and intellect in Afghanistan's bored society.
Organizing such a workshop has been one of my goals for a long time.
Finally, thanks to Geomap and Masoumeh Ebrahimi it became a reality.
More photos can be found on Civil Movement of Afghanistan along with a report. Manzarra who learned to blog in this workshop writes about using the internet to advance free speech and freedom of the press . Mokhtar Pedram, a journalist, shares his experience with us:
I was scared to come to the world of internet and blogging... Maybe it was a technical barrier.
But this one and half day workshop changed my perception… It wouldn't be true to say that all my problems with the internet were solved in these two days, but I did decide to start my blog, which proves just how effective this workshop has been.
Safeh says blogging is a new thing in Afghanistan and that academics and teachers have only just discovered it.
Zartosht writes that such workshops may be the most important step for journalism in Afghanistan.
Ecuador: Security and Privacy Concerns on the Internet · Global Voices
Picture by Presidencia de la República del Ecuador and reproduced under authorization
Ecuador has been in the headlines a lot in 2008 so far.
First, torrential rains have fallen and have left much of the country under water.
Then, the controversial dispute involving national sovereignty and its neighbor, Colombia, has also been in the news recently.
Finally, the announcement that has left Ecuador's government in hot water indicates that the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) has found shelter in the country.
However, something that has not been in the news, but may be just as worrisome is the question of security on the internet and the recent incidents of hacking.
The hacking of the page of the presidency occurred in the middle of February, and was committed by a hacker who openly mocked the security of government systems and assures he will get into other media portals.
Carlos Jumbo , who works in this profession explains that it is not the first time this happened in Ecuador and problems like this can be solved:
Morocco: Prison Break · Global Voices
On Monday, April 7, nine men convicted of involvement in the 2003 suicide bombings in Casablanca went missing from a Kenitra prison.
Prisoner rights advocacy group Ennassir said that the escape coincided with the beginning of a hunger strike by about 1,000 prisoners across Morocco.
A search is underway, but the prisoners have yet to be found.
A Moro in America shared an analysis of prison breaks as related to terror convicts and said:
- Kenitra's prison is notorious for being the scene of previous prison breaks.
Nino, a Ceuta-based drug lord, managed last year to buy his way out of the infamous prison.
None of the prison guards was suspended or punished after the Spaniard's evaded.
- Back to this weekend's evasion,Coincidently, the dog of the prison's director , along with its cage, were removed few days ago from the prison.
According to Almassae daily , the tunnel's end was right where the dog's cage used to be.
- So far in the history of Moroccan jails , two types of prisoners have managed to evade — the Al-Qadea members and the drug dealers.
The common denominators amongst the two is that they both belong to cash-rich powerful rings.
The prison guards can be easily coerced because not only they are underpaid, but they also work in a very corrupt environment where only money and bribes rule.
It's the culture of prisons in Morocco, just like it is the case with prisons in developing nations.
Madame Monet is amused by the similarities between this incident and the popular television program of the same name:
In a real-life prison break, nine convicted terrorists who escaped yesterday from a prison in Kenitra.
Apparently, just as in the real-life WWII movie, they tunneled out using a teaspoon!
They were convicted of involvement in the wave of 2003 Casablanca bombings.
Police seem to be manning the checkpoints all over Morocco.
I think the prisoners must have been watching Prison Break, one of the most popular shows in Morocco.
Too bad the guards must not have been watching it!
Argentina: Documentary on Indigenous People in Buenos Aires · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Indigenous Rights.
The documentary Runa Kuti, Urban Natives shows us the stories of four descendants of indigenous communities living in the city of Buenos Aires, and how they struggle with reclaiming their identity, rediscovering their culture and making a place for themselves in the city.
http://vimeo.com/32219379
The film focuses on several descendants of indigenous groups who all live in Buenos Aires.
Through their stories they share how they were raised sheltered from their own roots as their parents decided to shelter them from the exclusion and discrimination by not teaching them their indigenous language or customs, others grew up in ignorance of their ancestors origins, and how they have decided to embrace their tradition and culture as a way to empower themselves and take pride in their heritage.
Runa Kuti, Urban Natives, produced and directed by Paola Castaño and Dailos Batista Suárez, has been shown in several film festivals around the region, and in a push to get the message out to the greatest quantity of people, they have released it under a Creative Commons License.

Iranian bloggers write letters to Christ · Global Voices
It may seem surreal, but several Muslim bloggers have written letters to Jesus Christ in their blogs complaining about Western insults against Muslims, and particularly Dutch MP Geert Wilders' anti-Islamic film, Fitna.
Meanwhile, young Islamist Basij paramilitaries demonstrated in front of the Netherlands embassy in Tehran condemning Wilders' film.
Kosoof, a leading Iranian photoblogger, has published several photos from this demonstration.
One of the slogans in the photo above means "If carrying no veil means civilization, then animals are the most civilized."
Goldokhtar, a female religious student, starts her letter to Jesus by writing "Hello Mr. Jesus Christ".
She continues :
"Do you know what I am thinking?
When and where did all these these Fitnas start?
A few years ago these anti-Islamic films began to be produced.
Before the Islamic Revolution, nobody paid attention to Islam and its saints… After the Islamic Revolution other revolutions took off… Then they did not know what to do, and they started doing childish things to hurt Islam's image in the world."
The blogger adds that several films such as Not without My Daughter and 300 should be countered with films by Muslims.
Mehdi writes :
"Christ, I am a Muslim who likes you.
Don't be sad about insults to your brother Muhammad, the Prophet.
We all know these people are not your followers.
They are not the ones who carry the cross, but launch crusades and kill people."
The blogger questions whether the growing number of cinematic attacks on Muslims are coordinated.
Pangare writes to Jesus : "Help us to resist these insults... I know you support us and you can read my heart."
In addition to these Islamists, several other bloggers have shared their feelings and ideas on the film.
Arsham Parsi, a leading activist for homosexual rights in Iran, says : "There are rational ways to express an opinion on something or challenge ideas.
I watched this film, and I protest against it too."
Paroo Zadan writes :
"I watched it and I found it ridiculous.
How many Muslims are extremists?
I think Muslims should first produce films to counter Fitna's impact, and then try to think what makes people see us like this.
Filtering and threatening just strengthens the film.
Instead of jihads to kill people, our religious leaders should make jihads to make known to others the good side of Islam."

Thailand: YouTube self-censored lese majeste protest clip · Global Voices
Self-censorship on YouTube is working well - silently.
Yesterday, a FACT signer reported one of the silently banned clips, which can be viewed everywhere in the world, except Thailand.
Since agreement with Thailand's Ministry of Information and Communication Technology last year, YouTube's management agreed to block any video clips deemed offensive to Thai people or those that violate Thai law.
In other words, YouTube will do the censorship by themselves, so that the site will not be blocked again by the Ministry.
When users from Thailand try to access the reported link, http://youtube.com/watch?v=70m1ncXQjXA , they will find this message:
This video is not available in your country.
It is a lèse majesté law protest clip, which contains few caricature of the King images and Thailand flag, the royal anthem is played as a background music, and between those images, the clip runs the following messages in black over yellow background:
King Bhumibol Adulyadej of is a dictator.
He sends anyone who speaks against him to prison - for up to 15 years.
F**k the king of Thailand - long live free speech!
Article 112 of the Thai Criminal Code stipulates the penalty for a lèse majesté offence as 3-15 years' imprisonment.

Vlog International: collaboration across borders · Global Voices
Vlog International is a project bringing together Spanish speaking vloggers: people submit their ideas, one is chosen and everyone records their piece, someone edits them together and they are published on their site.
They began in 2006, when a group of friends got together to do a video homage for a vlogger friend : it was through his website that everyone had met, and they wanted to recognize that fact publicly.
The next project happened organically: the friend who had organized the first collaborative video was going through a rough spot in his life, and everyone else decided to record a birthday wish on video: they recorded themselves singing happy birthday, playing the song on instruments, dancing and sitting in front of cakes with candles, and that video can be found by following this link. They began calling these experiences "Sancocho de Video": sancocho is a name that refers to many different soups from all around Latin America.
The latest video by the Vlog International group is about a walk around the block.
Vloggers in Colombia, Israel, Canada, Germany and the USA all shared their surroundings.
You can see it by clicking here or by pressing play on the following video.
Vlog International already has 31 collaborative videos up on their blip.tv page and they are always hoping to add more video bloggers to their site.
All that is needed is for the person interested to make a 1 minute video: 30 seconds explaining where they are and who they are, and 30 seconds recording the following "mission" video, then uploading the video and emailing them the link.
Instructions in Spanish can be found here.
These videos have all been released under a Creative Commons license, and you can share in on the process by reading their wiki.
Browsing through their different episodes is a great way to get a global perspective on the same issue.
On the following video, the Vloggers take us on a tour away from the supermarkets and into the different traditional marketplaces of France, England, Italy, Germany, Mexico, Brazil, the USA, Chile, Spain and Colombia.
Online Obama campaign splits Ethiopian bloggers · Global Voices
Diaspora Ethiopians have been flexing their political muscles in the U.S., organising websites, rallies and email campaigns to persuade their compatriots to support Barack Obama's presidential run.
Many Ethiopians bloggers rallied to the cause, pledging cash and votes for the Democratic candidate whose father came from Kenya, a country that neighbours Ethiopia.
But others raised questions about the campaign, asking whether it was right to expect Ethiopian-Americans to vote en masse for any candidate.
At the head of the Obama pack was the new blog Ethiopians for Obama which, in Ethiopians Journey for Hope, said:
Most Ethiopians immigrated to America searching for the American dream—a dream for a better life and a new opportunity.
Most arrived in America with the determination to fulfil the promise that America embodies; destined to realize this dream armed with little more than hope on their side.
Ethiopians—like all Americans-embrace the message of Barack Obama, a message that our lives are intertwined with our infinite commonalities.
Ethiounited pointed to a YouTube video of Ethio-Americans speaking at an Obama campaign launch.
I have given a lot of money to the campaign since I was not able to take time of from work and go volunteer at the campaign headquarters in Chicago, although I have made phone calls on behalf of the campaign for every primary.
wrote Bernos in An Obama Minute.
Bernos has also been busy translating the Obama 'Yes we can' slogan into Amharic, one of Ethiopia's main languages, for a range of targeted campaign posters.
Ethioblog talked about its growing disillusion with the Clinton camp in Falling for Clinton and Clinton’s Doubletalk.
Ethiopian Politics Blog pointed to another YouTube video describing Obama as the "embodiment of the American dream".
But Abesha Bunna Bet sounded a strong note of caution in Even Ethiopians Are Crazy About Obama:
Ethiopians.
We are not a bunch of herds that needs direction.
We can not be told by any group (Ethiopians or not) who to vote for with out being told why.
And the ‘why’ should be answered by our individual research, and not by folks who wish to take advantage of us based on heritage.
Tobian ThinkTank's email inbox was flooded with 'Obamaganda' by friends and relatives.
When the blogger replied to them, saying he was backing Hilary Clinton, he got some hostile emails in response.
In Surely, it must be that lesbian school ... he wrote:
One curious thing to note about who's been sending me these emails has been that it has all come from black men.
My friends who are female and black are still rooting all for Clinton...
I think Hilary & Obama should eventually run a joint ticket.
They've divided the Democratic party straight down the middle line, and it is in their hands to bring the party, the country back together.
As this country stands at the edge of a recession, one of my officemates pointed out, imagine Hilary as the president, Obama as vice president and Bill Clinton as a 'first man'(?).
Is that a power house, or is that a power house?
The Mongrel described how he remained suspicious of Obama, despite the current level of "mass-hysteria" in support of the African-American candidate.
In Conspiracy Brother he wrote:
Seriously though someone please put your hands on me and tell me it's OK to be black and not vote for Obama...I think that's what I'm fighting with deep inside.
Either that or it's a case of OCD :-0
Indonesia: Ministry Orders Removal of Buddha Statue · Global Voices
Indonesia's commitment to promote religious tolerance has been questioned again after the Religious Affairs Ministry ordered a large Buddhist statue in the Tri Ratna Buddhist monastery in Tanjungbalai, North Sumatra, to be taken down after some 'hardliners' in the area complained against its presence.
A few months ago, leaders and members from other churches were attacked by Muslim 'fanatics' which led many people to observe that religious minorities are being harassed in Indonesia.
Indonesia is the most populated Muslim nation in the world.
The controversial Buddha statue that must be lowered in Tanjungbalai.
Source: Website of Buddhism Discussion Forum
The problem in North Sumatra started after a number of people calling themselves GIB / Gerakan Islam Bersatu (United Islamic Movement) began to consider the Buddha statue in Tri Ratna a threat to Islamic faith in the city.
They argued that the statue could upstage the city's historical symbol 'Balai di Ujung Tanduk' located in front of it.
GIB's letter demanding the removal of the statue was published in a Buddhism discussion forum website.
A discussion thread was also created to give support to the appeal of the Buddhist monks to the local government:
Well, it is Aceh 2011 and not Afghanistan 2001, it is Shariah “Veranda of Mecca -style” not Taliban, the statue is just another Buddha and not a 1700 years old part of the world´s cultural heritage and the height is merely 6 meters and not 53.
But in both cases the background of religious intolerance even aggressiveness, self-righteousness, narrow-mindedness and cultural barbarism, backed by the political establishment, are there.
Blogger LAPAK INFO notes that religious pluralism is now dead in Indonesia:
Israel: Teenage Girls Usage of Mobile Phones for Dating · Global Voices
Hiyam Hijazi-Omari and Rivka Ribak wrote a paper called "Playing With Fire: On the domestication of the mobile phone among Palestinian teenage girls in Israel".
In their research, they analyzed mobile phone practices among Palestinian teenage girls in Israel.
The Paper constructs a detailed account of mobile phone use among Palestinian Israeli girls who, at the time of the fieldwork (2003-2006), used mobile phones given to them by their illicit boyfriends, unbeknownst to their parents.
danah boyd writes on the Shift6 blog:
Palestinian boys give their girlfriends phones for the express purpose of being able to communicate with them in a semi-private manner without the physical proximity that would be frowned on.
At the same time, girls know that parents do not approve of them having access to such private encounters with boys - they go to great lengths to hide their mobiles and suffer consequences when they are found out.
While the boys offered these phones as a tool of freedom, they often came with a price.
Girls were expected to only communicate with the boy and never use the phone for any other purpose.
In the article, Hijazi-Omari and Ribak quote one girl as expressing frustration over this and saying “I did not escape prison only to find myself another prison.”
These girls develop fascinating practices around using the phone, hiding from people, and acquiring calling cards.
No doubt mobile communications technology is enabling teens in the Middle East to bypass cultural norms by providing them with access to private communication channels.

Egypt: Residential Independence · Global Voices
OTV is a private Egyptian satellite TV channel which has attracted the attention of its viewers from the day it was launched, thanks to its liberal approach, the issues it tackles and the way it tackles them, which is different from conservative and traditional TV channels.
Egyptian blogger Zaman El Wasl (Ar), discusses here an episode of a talk show that was aired about women's independence.
I love to follow - whenever it is possible - a program called "Masa'ak Sukkar Zeyada" on OTV.
And one part of this program tries to solve people's emotional problems.
And through this part, I got to know a young writer called Marwa Rakha, who tries to help in solving the viewers problems, and gives them advice that I normally like.
Anyway, during last Sunday's episode, Marwa, Georgette Quelleny - a parliament member, and the Radio/TV host Buthaina Kamel were invited to discuss women's independence through their commentary on a documentary called Six Girls.
The blogger then continues:
As far as I understood, the movie is about girls and women who were forced to leave their parents' homes and live alone to work or study in other cities.
Most of the discussion was about the idea of women's independence - more than discussing the movie itself.
Their opinion about independence was related more to the departure of women from their parent's home and living alone whenever it is possible.
Marwa and Buthaina were defending this point of view while Georgette - and so am I - were against it, as long as women are not forced to do so.
My stance against this idea is not because of religious or moral reasons, and not because I am afraid of what society will say about a girl who lives alone in a separate house while here parents live in the same city!!
I am against this idea because I do not consider - residential - independence is the real symbol of a human being's independence, whether he is a man or a woman.
I believe that independence is the ability of someone to take decisions without the need of others — unless he is asking for their advice.
Independence can also be someone's financial independence and his ability to depend on himself in getting his daily needs as well as taking care of his family members' needs.
One of the viewers of the show had a different point of view.
One of the viewers - whose voice seemed to be like a mother's voice - asked: Why do children want to deprive their families from being close to each other and share love and care till it's time for them to leave.
In fact, people here in Egypt are used to living with their parents until they get married.
And that's why many of those who commented on this post were against the idea of people moving from their parent's homes, especially for girls.
Tunisia: Al Radeyef Protests - When Bloggers Give a Voice to the Voiceless · Global Voices
With little to no coverage of the plight of thousands of people at the rich Phosphorous mines of Gafsa, Redyef and Oum el Arayess on mainstream media, Tunisian bloggers and activists are turning to the Internet to tell the world their story.
Protests by workers against inflation, the rising cost of living and the right to employment in the rich mines, have been dealt with a security clampdown by the government, which has arrested countless of protesters. And for the first time ever, Tunisian bloggers join hands with activists and other online users to give a voice to the voiceless - on Twitter, like Houieda's Tweets; by joining and contributing to a Facebook group to stream updates and news about situation (134 members so far); and by uploading videos to YouTube (which is banned in Tunisia).
A series of protests broke out after the final list of those who will be employed a Phosphates Gafsa company on January 5, which are still continuing today in Oum el Arayes and Al Radeef.
For more than eight weeks now young men from Al Radeef hold protests in tents, and announce hunger strikes, to call for the minimum requirements of social justice and their right in employments.
At Oum el Arayes, the widows who have lost their breadwinners in the accidents at the company, still live in tents, on the outskirts of the province of Oum el Arayes, which are located in the Phosphates Gasfa company, where they are calling for their sons to work at the company.
Fatima also posts photographs of the protests.
Carpediem-selim (Fr), meanwhile, writes a detailed post about police brutality against the strikers :
Spring has come to Japan with the first cherry blossoms of the year.
People anxiously wait for the blossom forecast announced by the Meteorological Agency, while marking their calendar for the best day for blossom viewing (hanami).
As the cherry blossoms front (sakurazensen) moved northwards, the cherry trees started blooming in Shizuoka, Kumamoto and Tokyo on March 22, a few days earlier than average.
Many Japanese bloggers have taken the opportunity to snap pictures of the blossoms.
Rieko Koizumi of One Drop Room with Flowers, a photo blog that features pictures of flowers she encounters in her daily life, took a picture of a cherry flower before the cherry blossom season was "officially announced".

Tajikistan: Unjust Distribution of Wealth · Global Voices
It is almost impossible to have a profitable business in Tajikistan if you follow all rules and regulations set by the state.
People bitterly joke that the easiest way to become a wealthy man is to become a governmental official or a person close to the government.
Perhaps, it is true, as it gives you some kind of "immunity" from the checks, competition and possible prosecution — the higher the post, the more you get.
Neweurasia summarizes a survey of Avesta News Agency about the richest people in Tajikistan:
If you are a wealthy person living in Tajikistan, it means that either (1) you’re a governmental official, or (2) you’re a former governmental official, or (3) you’re a businessman who avoids paying taxes, or (4) you’re an entertainment star, or (5) you’re a drug-smuggler.
If you’re not a governmental official and you are wealthy, it means you have krisha ("a roof", or patron from amongst the governmental officials).
The report shows – and it is relatively true - that even to become a popular entertainment star one needs to have unofficial patronage by somebody in the government.
In another post neweurasia discusses doing business in Tajikistan:
Your krisha can be a criminal, a high official in the government, especially in a law enforcement agency or a former warlord.
It is better to have a krisha from law enforcement agencies or from the government because the criminals and former warlords are not that much influential in Tajikistan .
Tojvar opines on the "weathiest Tajiks list":
The governmental officials in Tajikistan never disclose their wealth and allege that they make their living only with the official monthly salary — 200 USD — although this is not enough in the capital city.
My questions here: Why do they have that much wealth, while I should be a labor migrant in Russia?
To be fair, it is necessary to admit that those who enjoy benefits for the time being, always risk to lose business with every new wake of the property redistribution among the elites; no matter how influential your patron in the governmental structures is, you may lose both your immunity and your property.
Last week, one of the most successful Tajik businessmen Maruf Orifov was sentenced by the Supreme Court to 8,5 years of imprisonment with confiscation of property for alleged bribery and tax evasion.
He owned the largest retail chain “Orima” in Dushanbe.
John Musarra at Tajiksitan Journal desribes his shopping experience at Orima, while Ravshan thinks that the Supreme Court’s decision was inadequately harsh and would negatively affect the country’s investment climate.
In any case, many in Tajikistan suspect that this trial is nothing else but a raider attack with the purpose to take over some else’s lucrative business.
Tajeconomy shares this opinion and elaborates:
But the main intrigue here is that – who is going to privatize Orima?
If the trial was fabricated with a purpose to take over the “Orima” chain, its next owner (or the patron of this person) can be considered as a mastermind of the trial.
If the trial is indeed fabricated, who might have such power and resources to manipulate the law enforcement bodies?

Yemen Times journalist Hamed Thabet describes the case:
Nojoud Muhammed Nasser arrived at court by herself on Wednesday, April 2, looking for a judge to handle her case against her father, Muhammed Nasser, who forced her two months ago to marry Faez Ali Thamer, a man 22 years her senior.
The child also asked for a divorce, accusing her husband of sexual and domestic abuse.

Venezuela: The Simpsons Not Welcome Anymore · Global Voices
It seems that the Venezuelan government does not care much for Matt Groening’s show, "The Simpsons."
The American TV show, very popular for over ten years, was banned recently on one of Venezuela’s private networks by order of the government.
Apparently some complaints were received at the government’s controlling agency for media because The Simpsons was being aired at 11 am.
It seems strange that after decades of popularity, that this show could have any complaint in Venezuela.
Nevertheless, the banning has come as breaking news and has become a scandal by public opinion, not only because of it happening so suddenly, but also because of its programming slot was substituted by Baywatch.

Egypt: Anti-Strike Facebook Group Formed · Global Voices
To circumnavigate censorship, activists in the Arab world are strongly leaning on online tools to get their messages across and expose what they describe as state brutality against civilians.
Word about last week's April 6 strike in Egypt was spread on a Facebook group, which has so far attracted more than 71,200 members.
Now Egyptian blogger GEMYHOoOD (Ar) tells us about an anti-strike Facebook group, which has around 1,000 followers.
GEMYHOoOD is obviously not pleased that President Hosni Mubarak's supporters have found their way to Facebook and says:
It is obvious that hypocrites and Mubarak's dogs have discovered that Facebook is nice and through it, you are able to bring together idle youth, who have nothing else to do, and just like 70,000 people were gathered for the strike, they can bring together 70,000 against it.
Suddenly you find a paid advertisement on the left of the Facebook site, which condemns rioting and disturbing Egypt's national security and calls for participating in a Facebook group against the idea of the strike and what happened during it of disturbance to Egypt's national security.
The group describes itself on Facebook saying:
From Facebook the call for the April 6 strike came, and from Facebook the campaign to condemn the destruction of people's property and terrorising peaceful people should come.
What happened in Al Mahalla is a danger to everyone and to Egypt's national security.
Political powers in particular bear the responsibility for the situation getting out of hand without being able to control it.
The security forces too are to blame after being brutal to people without discrimination.

و المنتجات الأمريكية بسبب معاملتهم الغير إنسانية للعرب
و المنتجات البريطانية بسبب تفتيشهم للبابا شنودة في المطار
و المنتجات الصينية بسبب عدم إيمانهم بأي من الديانات السماوية

Boycott Danish products because of the offensive cartoons
And Dutch products because of films which ridicule religion
And American products because of the inhumane way in which they treat Arabs
And British products because they searched Pope Shenuda at the airport
And Chinese products because they don't believe in any of the monotheistic religions
And Egyptian products because some people swear at the religions of others when they get into fights
This is why, stemming from the belief of this blog, to protect monotheistic religions and good manners,
I call upon you to boycott the world!
Boycott the entire world.
Chilean Shorts: Micro and Mini Movies on the Web · Global Voices
From Chile, three examples of online video creation: first, a Chilean pre-candidate for the presidency takes advantage of online video tools to produce documentaries and interviews for web distribution, next, two independent short film producers with videos which talk about poverty, disabilities, old habits which don't have such a hard time dying and, why not?
Love.
Marcelo Trivelli, previously mentioned on Global Voices for his interest in promoting the One Laptop per Child project in Chile as part of his presidential program.
The following video was uploaded on his YouTube channel, and speaks about the situation of children living in the streets of Santiago de Chile, where drugs and theft are their means of life.
It is subtitled in English, you can view the original version in Spanish by following this link.
Also making videos about issues that matter to him is vlogger José Cordova Llanos: he won the "Genera" online video contest against abuse with his short film titled "Whisper", which despite the language barrier, carries a message about the effects of psychological abuse that can be understood by people from all over the world.
His next two videos also participated on an online 1 minute video contest, in this case, the Teleton in Chile: his touching "Teach me" video carries a message in favor of teaching children not to discriminate illustrating it with the simple image of a child cutting paper dolls, while "limited" is a humorous scenario that shows that being "common sense" impaired is far more limiting than being unable to move unassisted.
A quirky third video by josecordovallanos which I really liked is the "Bad Habits" video, mocking the current paranoid trends on security.
Subtitled in English, it follows:
The last video, by YouTube user Patton1212 is simply titled "I love you".

AIDS - A Taboo in the Arab World · Global Voices
AIDS, the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a taboo word in the Arab world.
But the scary word has managed to crop up in many blog posts this week - from Jordan, Iraq, Palestine, Bahrain and Yemen.
Jordanian blogger Hareega, a doctor by profession, shares this 'uncomfortable conversation' he has had with an acquaintance about his work at the HIV Aids clinic:
A friend asked, "How's your work this month"
"Good, I'm doing HIV clinics three times a week"
"HIV? like AIDS?"
"Yes"
"Watch out"
"Watch out from what?"
He looked me like I was an idiot, "Watch out from the HIV"
"Why should I watch out?"
"Well, watch out, it's HIV, it's AIDS"
"But why should I watch out?
I don't sleep with my patients in the clinic"
"I know idiot, but just watch out, it's AIDS"
"I don't inject drugs with them either"
"I know I know, but just watch out"
"From what?"
"Listen, I'm no scientist (obviously), but you gotta watch out, or I have to start watching out from you"
Hareega continues:
Since January 1st, 2008, twenty-two new cases of HIV were diagnosed in Jordan.
Public knowledge about HIV among Jordanians, especially the "well-educated": Zero, and declining.
Iraqi Layla Anwar too is incensed at the way this topic is "broached" in the Arab world - despite the increasing incidence of the disease in the region.
While watching a television programme on the issue, the blogger notes:
Was watching a program some months ago, on Arabic Al-Jazeerah on HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases in the Arab World.
The producer cleverly attempted to broach this "sensitive" and taboo subject, by presenting it as a religious program and invited a guest speaker who is a specialist in both medicine and religious sciences i.e Islamic theology.
Layla explains:
HIV carriers are on the increase in the Arab World.
No one would like to admit that but that is a fact.
We all know how HIV is transmitted and we all know that the practice of safe sex and the screening of blood banks is a must.
So this is not what really caught my attention in the program.
What caught my attention is that HIV and STD's are also on the rise among married heterosexual couples in the Arab World and not just among homosexuals.
The invited guest's speciality was epidemiology and infectious diseases.
And in the realm of his practice, he encountered several cases (undeclared in public statistics) of straight couples for the most part married, infected with STD's and HIV in particular.
In 99% of the cases, the woman was infected by her husband.
A husband who had unprotected extra-marital relations, with other women and sometimes with other men.
In 99% of the cases, the man believing himself to be invincible, had refused the idea of protection i.e the use of a condom.

On taboos, Layla says:
Of course you understand that talking about this subject in the Arab World is very taboo.
A lot of denial surrounds it and a lot of rationalizations, to the effect that "us in muslim societies don't have such things", "sweep it under the carpet, and don't let the neighbors know- what will people think"....etc.
The wall of tradition and culture is so dense that it is nearly impossible to talk about this subject in public without being accused of being "decadent, lewd and immoral."
Meanwhile, AIDS victims die in silence, quarantined in rooms made of shame and guilt.
Amal A, from Palestine, also tackles the topic of Aids, noting her disgust at how a court case was handle in Egypt, where the prosecutor told one of the men involved in the trial, when he was informed him that he is HIV positive: "People like you should be burnt alive.
You do not deserve to live."
If Egypt is going to throw in jail all Egyptian men who have sex with men, they will need many more prisons. (...)
The criminalization of AIDs is a disaster!!!
Othering and demonizing patients who are HIV positive or have AIDS will not help protect Egyptians.
But this is not about protecting Egyptians at all.
It's about the state scapegoating the weak to consolidate its power uber alles.
But things are changing slowly and there seems to be a silver lining.
Bahraini Butterfly will soon be attending in Cairo, entitled Independent Artists/Bloggers Responding to AIDS in the Arab Region. هذه هي المرة الأولى التي سيتسنى لي فيها حضور فعالية تخص برنامج الامم المتحدة الانمائي في البحرين، كما ستكون المرة الأولى ايضا التي ستتاح لي فيها فرصة اللقاء بالمدونين والمبدعين العرب من مختلف الاقطار العربية. وسأشارككم بالطبع بما سأكتشفه من اسرار ودهاليز تتعلق بهذا المرض المخيف الذي لايزال الحديث عنه محظورا في معظم دولنا العربية.
The workshop will involve bloggers and creative Arabs in the areas of photography, film making and other media arts.
This is the first time I will be attending an event organised by the United Nations Development Programme in Bahrain and also meet with bloggers and artists from around the Arab world.
I will definitely share with you the secrets I will uncover about this scary disease, where even talking about it is prohibited in most of our Arab countries.
And last but not least, Armies of Liberation, links to news sources about a miracle Aids herbal medicine, developed in Yemen which claims to have the cure for the deadly virus.
Damascus: The Destruction of The Old City · Global Voices
Damascus prides itself on being the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world.
The history of Damascus goes back well into 8000 BC.
In every corner of its ancient alleys there's a taste of every historical era there was to be found.
The city that had withstood everything from earthquakes to invasions for nearly 10 millennia, is now crumbling under the threat of... "Modernism"!
Sasa from the Syria News Wire, compiled a series of posts about the situation of the old city of Damascus, and the efforts taking place for the protection and conservation of the city.
Part one of the series deals with last year's plan to tear down the ancient neighborhood of Al-Amara in order to widen the roads outside the walls of the old city.
The plan caused an outrage among Syrians, and protests were organized everywhere until they were quietly dropped, for now.
Shopkeepers were furious at the plans, a Facebook and Blogger campaign was launched. That led to a petition.
And eventually journalists got wind of the proposals and it made the international news.
Then the bombshell - just months before Damascus began its year as Arab Capital of Culture, UNESCO threatened to withdraw Damascus's World Heritage Site status unless more is done to protect the Old City.
Bab al-Faradis, al-Amara, Damascus
The second part is dedicated to the conservation works down in Medhat Pasha street (Street Called Straight), the longest and one of the oldest roads in old Damascus.
Sasa aknowledges the importance of the this project as the street has been in shackles for a long time, but laments the ill-planning and the indiscriminate replacement of culturally important parts of the ancient market, like the old Ottoman-time roof, that has a special significance which he explains:
The tin roofs over Medhat Pasha and Souq Al-Hamidiyeh date from the Ottoman refurbishment of the main Souqs.
During the insurgency against the French occupation, they were punctured by gunfire.
And they've remained that way for almost one hundred years.
The shafts of sunlight which pierce into the dark souqs are blindingly beautiful, and a daily reminder of Syria's struggle for independence.
But the centuries-old black Medhat Pasha roof, which was decorated by history, has been replaced by a new white one.
Medhat Pasha Street (Street Called Straight), with its ancient tin roof.
Part three, takes us on an open ended ride into the ancient quarter of Saroujah, a neighborhood that had witnessed some destruction in the past to make space for character-less apartment blocks.
The plans to bulldoze the rest of the neighborhood were put on hold, and the decision to go through with them or not is to be taken by the end of this year, says Sasa:
But recently, the organisation which looks after the Old City - and works well with the European Union to do it - has taken over responsibility for Saroujah.
So is a change in Saroujah's fortunes in store?
In the past few months, they have re-paved part of the area (with far less inconvenience than in Medhat Pasha).
So does this mean destruction is no longer on the cards?
Documents released by the Old City modernisation authorities show that they are going to make a decision on the future of Saroujah by the end of this year.
Sarouja, Damascus
As the grip of the new corporate culture tightens around the old city, it seems the only way to saving it are the efforts of the civil society, and it has succeeded in reverting the disastrous plans in al-Amara, so there might still be hope at the end of the tunnel. Photos courtesy of Sasa.
11-year-old Chinese environmentalist and Circuit Board Recycling · Global Voices
The blog "Crossroads," which looks at corporate social responsibility in China, draws our attention to a an article about an 11-year-old environmentalist in southwest China.
The youngster took it upon himself to search for the source of river pollution and caught the attention of reporters and officials.
Last October, Chen was playing on the bank of Jialing River with his parents and found refuse in the water.
This spurred him to find out where it came from.
After investigating for six months in his spare time, Chen wrote a report on pollution in the river and suggested some measures to clean it up.
Rich also writes about the 11 year old environmentalist, saying
This is another case of how I think China will eventually grow towards cleaning up its environment.
Individuals, and collectives, will be motivated on a personal level to investigate contaminations, conduct resaerch, develop solutions, and pressure local officials and businesses.
Meanwhile, China Environmental News Digest posts an article about recycling that may be bad for the environment; the dismantling of electronic circuit boards.
The article cites a new study of electronics recycling in China from Hong Kong Baptist University.
The study found that a town in southeastern China family-run recycling workshops had high levels of dangerous metals, and that people spread contaminated dust as they walked around.

Iran: A mysterious explosion in mosque · Global Voices
In south Iran, an explosion at a mosque in the city Shiraz killed at least 12 people and wounded about 200 people on April 12.
Fars, a semi-official government news website reported that the blast was caused by a bomb.
Later, several Iranian officials insisted the blast was the result of an accident.
The mosque’s Imam believes it was a bomb attack by unidentified militants, and has called the victims "martyrs".
Iranian bloggers have covered this story and shared their ideas on this bloody event and the rumors surrounding it.
Necas says :
For me as an Iranian, the censorship of this news in Iranian media is very significant.
Until 2am in the morning there was no news about this explosion on Iranian TV.
The same station would cover hostage-taking in schools or supermarkets in the USA and start to speculate.
Then would say that the USA imposes censorship on its media.
In Iran, 12 hours after the explosion, the news is broadcast, and they say the blast was not caused by bomb.
They don't call the victims martyrs, but simply dead people.
The video of this explosion has been visited more than 60,000 times on YouTube.
A few moments after explosion on the video, a voice asks people to evacuate, and also says, "To become a martyr is our wish...": Parcham criticises Iranian TV for not mentioning the news regarding explosion. The blogger say you would think Arabs must be the real owners of Iran, since news about Iraq and Palestine are covered immediately, but not ours.
The religious center focused its teaching on Bahi Faith and Wahabism. Bacheyeh khat writes about the Rahpouyan Vesal religious center.
The blogger says a young cleric who was wounded in the Iran-Iraq war named Mohmmad Anjavinejad was the founder.
Although most of the audience is said to be young people between the ages of 15 and 20, some consider his teaching is outdated, and joke that his followers sleep in empty tombs in graveyards.
The blogger adds that members of the religious group ran for office in municipal elections but won only one seat out of 11 on the City Council.
Dominican Republic test drives new metro system in Santo Domingo · Global Voices
People scream, yell and cheer as they see it pass: in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic, the newest celebrity is the Metro transportation system.
The city is buzzing at the new metro system which starting last Saturday began operating tentatively for testing to bring visitors to and from the Santo Domingo Book Fair .
Excited Dominicans have been recording the metro passing by their houses on the different test runs and uploaded videos of themselves walking into the completed metro stations and travelling in train carriages which are so new they still have bubble-wrap on the seats.
User noe0324 has uploaded a video that manages to transmit the overwhelming expectation and pride for this massive public transportation method.
On the first minute you can hear and see the excitement of the people who standing on their roofs at the side of the metro track, cheer, wave flags and clap as it passes by.
The video can be seen by following this link or by viewing it on the embedded video that follows.
DJBlastor shows us another view: people standing in line 3 people deep waiting to get aboard the metro cars, and then the people rushing into the cars to see if they can get a seat.
He has 3 other videos recorded that same day, with political commentary which seems to be the underlining current of support for the actual president as well as rare footage of people crammed inside a metro car, and most of them cracking brilliant smiles.
As mentioned previously, the metro seems to have raised President Leonel Fernandez' popularity, and it was high to begin with, since it's his second non-consecutive presidential period.
The following video was uploaded by macaco993 and you can hear the crowd cheering and chanting "Leonel, Leonel, Leonel":
Supercrackers also recorded last week's calmer entrance into the Metro system, where she travels through the station, down stairs and sits, while watching children and adults happily pop the bubble-wrap between the seats.
U.S. Papal Visit: The World Reacts · Global Voices
As Pope Benedict XVI makes his first papal visit to the United States, the media and blogosphere are in a frenzy - primarily due to the sexual abuse scandal that shook the foundation of the American Catholic church six years ago.
The Pope addressed the issue in Washington D.C. on Thursday, speaking with victims of sexual abuses, which pleased some bloggers but for others was too little too late.
Darryl Wolk, a Canadian blogger, is of the former category, stating:
As a Catholic, I am glad that Pope Benedict XVI addressed this issue head on.
It will take more than words and apologies, to heal the scars caused by the actions of some priests towards the victims.
I think today was a step in the right direction for my church.
Leon J. Suseran of the Guyana Chronicle Blog, wishes he could have been there:
IF there was a time that I wished I was in the United States, then it would be right now, when the leader of the world’s 1.2 Billion Roman Catholics Pope Benedict XVI makes his first apostolic journey to that nation.
His visit comes at a time that the holy Roman Catholic Church is under attack from all corners, including the recent sex-abuse scandals that have rocked the Church, but not the faith of tens of millions worldwide, who have continued under these dark times to practice the faith that was handed down by the apostles.
From Trinidad and Tobago, Jeremy Taylor, on the other hand, is frustrated by the Pope's inaction:
It's not enough for the Pope to be "ashamed" of his American paedophile priests, as he claimed to be today on his way to the US.
He also has to do something about them.
Actually, a lot more than just "something."
Talk Turkey wonders what effect the papal visit will have on the U.S. elections:
I wonder if the Pope will meet with Obama, Hillary, and McCain as well.
After all, this is an election year.
And there are an estimated 70 million Catholics in the U.S., some of whom I would suspect have experienced divorce, practiced sex before marriage, had an abortion, and were (or know someone who have been) abused as a child by the clergy.
And Dave Weinberg of Jewneric focuses on the positives of the Pope's visit to a synagogue, which sets an historical precedent:
The Pope going to an American shul is, however, a very big deal and really shows the positive progress our two communities have made.
It is even more appropriate that the Pope visit a synagogue on the eve of Passover, being that the Last Supper was a Seder.

The following photo essay captures a few moments of these festivals.
From Rakwana in Sri Lanka, a temple car festival in photographs by 'Irakuwanai' Nirshan.
One of the focal points of the festival is the temple car - "Temple cars are chariots used to carry idols of Hindu gods.
The car pulling is usually on festival days where many folks pull the cart."

Turkey: Armenian Genocide Commemoration in Istanbul · Global Voices
April 24, 2012, marks the 97th anniversary of the massacre and deportation of around 1.5 million Armenians living in the then Ottoman Empire.
Widely considered by many historians as well as the parliaments of several countries to be an act of genocide, the issue remains an emotive one.
Yet, while recent attempts to officially normalize relations and resolve historical grievances between Armenia and Turkey have faltered, the situation has been changing slowly in other areas, and not least in terms of civil society activity.
Indeed, in recent years there has been more open discussion and debate in Turkish society, as well as in its media, about the events of 1915 than ever before.
While Turkey still denies the charge of genocide, that change is nonetheless unprecedented as one Turkish tweep commented.
@Ziya_Meral: How much #Turkey has changed in 10 years..
Newspapers are full of articles clearly naming 1915 a genocide, people marching to commemorate..
Naturally, most activity, online and off, came from ethnic Armenians in Armenia and its large Diaspora, much of which came into being because of the deportations, but while the memorial in Istanbul was small, it was at least poignant.
It was also live-tweeted in Turkish and English.

A statement from the Turkish Human Rights Association (IHD) was also addressed to the heads of the two Armenian Churches in Armenia and Lebanon.
British-Armenian Genocide Historian Ara Sarafian also spoke at the commemoration.
An Armenian folk song ('At the Break of Dawn', compiled by Arusyak Sahakian), arranged by Ayşe Tütüncü, well known pianist/musician from Turkey , and performed by 42 Turkish musicians.

What's Carter Doing in the Middle East? · Global Voices
Former US President Jimmy Carter just concluded talks with Palestinian Hamas leaders in Cairo, Egypt.
First, it was the turn of the US Presidential elects to snub the visit.
Now, bloggers from the region join them to rebuff it.
Will from Palestinian blog Kabobfest sarcastically writes:
His trip undermines the American/Israeli policy of negating the Palestinian elections after years of demanding them.
It causes ripples in their brilliant peace-forwarding vision of ignoring half the Palestinians, the same half in charge of Gaza.
Will continues:
What will this nutty ex-Nobel prize winner suggest next?
We include Syria and Iran in regional peace talks?
Ha!
The Sudanese Thinker, from Sudan, says Carter's trip to the Middle East:
… is based on well-meaning intentions but is ultimately flawed thanks to the “super religious, no-comprise” mindset of the people he wants to talk to.
I emphasize the “well-meaning intentions” part because Jimmy’s characterization as someone evil and anti-Semitic is something I disagree with.
I understand that the title of his notorious book is provocative but that doesn’t mean he is what he’s accused of.
After all, it was Carter who negotiated the peace deal between Egypt and Israel.
He further adds:
I don’t think Carter gets that Hamas - like al-Qaeda - isn’t a typical rational enemy.
They’re religious right-wing radicals hellbent on regaining back what they perceive to be “the land of Islam.”
This is why I doubt Hamas can ever agree to a true and long-lasting peace.
But hey, I give Jimmy credit for at least trying.
Plus, you never know.
He might actually be able to convince Hamas to release Gilad Shalit.
From Israel, Aussie Dave writes:
He might be foolish and decrepit, but Jimmy Carter also happens to be an ex President of the United States.
So when he decides to meet up with a terrorist group dedicated to Israel’s destruction, said terrorist group feels legitimized.
He also concludes:
I have to agree with Shimon Peres on this one.
Carter has caused great damage to Israel and the peace process, and continues to do so.
Rabbi Yohana closely examines Carter's stances on Tibet and Darfur.
Turning his attention to the Middle East, the blogger explains:
Today, Carter roams around Israel, visits Sderot, gets rebuffed by Israel’s leaders, and ignored by the Shin Bet.
Any goodwill created when they inked the Peace deal with Egypt nearly 30 years ago has evaporated.
I just have one suggestion for the Israelis - pay up.
For a mere 5 million of so, Carter could “re-examine” his views on the subject.
He could “have a new understanding” and become more of an ally.
We could get a ghost writer from the Shalem Center to whip together a new book too.
As it says in Pirkei Avot, “K’ne l’cha chaver”, “acquire for yourself a friend.”
It will do Israel a lot more good to support Jimmy Carter with backsheesh, than to rebuff him.
Still in Israel, Batya questions Carter's impartiality and says:
Former US President Jimmy Carter sees the world through distorted lenses.
Yes, that's the nicest way I can describe him.
He blames Israel for everything.
But Carter has a still managed to garner the support of a new fan in the Middle East.
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia tells us how much she loves the former US president, saying:
Seriously I love this man more and more.
This man seems from the few people who know the true meaning of Peace Negotiations , the true meaning of Peace negotiations in my humble point of view is to sit down with everyone involved in the fight or the conflict even those bloody ones and to listen to them in order to reach to point of agreement.
I really respected him for his daring decision to have a direct channel with Hamas and Syria as primary parties in the conflict of the middle east regardless of what is said , regardless of what the American , Israeli and Egyptian Media are saying , this is what it should be for the sake of everyone in the Middle East if we truly want a just unbiased Peace. ** This article also appears in Voices without Votes.
Korea: Roh Moo Hyun and Japanese Netizens · Global Voices
The previous Korean President, Roh Moo Hyun, as I wrote a previous post, ‘ Roh Moo Hyun Syndrome (March 30, 2008)’ has become famous even after his retirement due to his casual life style.
While he generated hyeom-han gam-jeong (Japanese antipathy against Korea) during his governance, his life has been introduced by a major portal site of Japan, 2ch.
A Korean netizen introduced Japanese netizens’ reactions to the photos.
It is interesting to observe how he is still an issue and even in other places (newspapers in other countries introduced the Roh Gan Ji Wave after retirement).
PangeaDay: Videos to change the world on May 10th · Global Voices
On May 10th 2008 at 18:00 GMT, 24 films will be broadcast during a 4 hour event.
What makes this different is that this event, PangeaDay will be broadcast from six locations worldwide in seven different languages worldwide to be viewed through internet, television or cellphones with one unique purpose: to make each other know about the lives of others and focus on what makes us similar, instead of what makes us different and let us work together towards peace.
This initiative came from Egyptian filmmaker Jehane Noujaim's wish.
As a TED Prize winner she was granted a wish in addition to a $100 000 USD award.
PangeaDay is her wish, to change the world and create a day in which people of the world could come together through film.
Her 2006 acceptance speech can be found here.
The logistics of PangeaDay are awe inspiring: from Cairo, Kigali, London, Los Angeles, Mumbai and Rio de Janeiro, films, live music and speakers will come together to inspire the whole world.
The films chosen have been selected from more than 25000 films from over 100 hundred countries.These movies all share some characteristics such as being able to inspire, transform and enabling us to experience life through another's eyes.
Queen Noor of Jordan, will be one of the speakers, along with musician and activist Bob Geldorf, Christiane Amanpour from CNN and the Iranian rock group Hypernova.
While at these locations people will be getting together, all around the world parties and groups of friends can sign up and show that they will be tuned in: you can attend an open event in your hometown or even host your own.
However, Pangea Day isn't just about getting together during 4 hours.
The idea is for the event to get people inspired, talking and making changes.
It has also allowed others to participate not only as viewers.
Through partner organization Nokia, aspiring filmmakers in different locations throughout the world have been given video enabled mobile devices to some people in rural areas, refugee camps, and film schools, so they too can portray their stories.
People can also upload their own videos for a chance to win a Nokia N95 8GB mobile device.
This partnership brings us a Myanmar refugee in India recording children's laughter, an Iranian family in a refugee camp in Afghanistan recording their idea of Hope, and an Indian in Bangalore filming the cutting down of Banyan trees... and children planting new trees.
You can view these and other videos on this page.
So there are many different ways to participate.
Don't miss the chance to be a part of this and make sure to tell others and spread the word.
Iran: Turning a Page on Racism Against Afghans · Global Voices
Several bloggers expressed their disgust at learning that Afghans living in Isfahan, Iran were banned from a park by the authorities on April 1, 2012, the 13th day of Nowruz New Year celebrations.
It is customary to mark this day by spending the day outdoors picnicking.
Although an official in Isfahan denied that Afghans had been targeted, a Facebook event was created to encourage Iranians to fight racism.
The logo on the page says, "We are all Afghans".
Nearly 4000 people supported the campaign.
Aside from many legal Afghan immigrants and refugees, over one million undocumented Afghan refugees currently live in Iran, according to some reports.
Iranian blogger Sepid and Siah (meaning White and Black) says :
My Afghan brother and sister I am ashamed.
I am ashamed that my country where you took refuge, is not a good host to you...
But what can I expect from some people within establishment who try to humiliate you for years, they have already humiliated Iranians.
But I am ashamed that my own people do not understand you.
Khorshidneshan writes :
Racism is one of the characteristics of Iranians.
The problem is not only the Islamic Republic and a stupid official in Isfahan who orders to ban Afghans from gathering in park.
The problem comes from us, people because we support it and do not protest...
The discrimination against them is not a new thing.
It is very difficult or impossible for Afghans to get an Iranian identity card even after living for long years in the country or marrying an Iranian.
Shahin Shar blog says let's end racism against Afghans today in Iran.
The blogger has published several photos showing, in one case, how Afghans are banned from a swimming pool.
Because of the heavy censorship in Iran may we never know what really happened that day in the park.
Meanwhile we can be sure that many Iranians know there is persistant discrimination against Afghans, and they wish to turn a page.

During a well-advertised event, Ecuador has joined other countries that offer free distribution of information and content under the guidance of licenses called Creative Commons.
Delegations from Colombia, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Venezuela, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Honduras, Dominican Republic and Cuba arrived the day before the event to take part in the 2nd CREAD Andes Congress and the 2nd VIRTUAL EDUCA Summit, where they discussed the quality of distance education.
Also present were 26 experts from 4 continents Europe, Asia, America and Africa.
The launching of Creative Commons (CC) Ecuador was scheduled to be part of this meeting and was organized by the Loja's Technical University (UTPL), member of CREAD.
After months of hard work, mentors Juan José Puertas Ortega and Carlos Correa Loyola saw their hard work pay off.
GVO has been following the events as Eduardo Avila posted on this posts here and here..
Creative Commons 3.0 in Ecuador, is the 45th jurisdiction worldwide to adopt the Creative Commons licensing and according to the press release, they are "interested in promoting cultural production and research, so we have taken the initiative to launch the Creative Commons licenses as an alternative to ‘all-rights-reserved’ copyright.
To achieve this, we have been going through a process of adapting the international license to our legislation, in discussions both public and private, and we have worked together with our community stakeholders and notable representatives in the field of copyright to reach a public presentation of its launch.”
More can be read in the new Scripta (pdf).
For those Ecuadorans who couldn't attend the launch of the CC Ecuador were able to follow the developments, Loja's Technical University website Open UTPL contains more information.

Iran: Ahmadinejad's Car, A Woman, And a Hungry Old Man · Global Voices
An online video showing a young woman jumping onto the hood of the car of Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad while he was visiting Bandar-Abbass (a southern coastal city of Iran) on 10 April, 2012, is making a big splash.
The young woman speaks briefly to the president whose vehicle is surrounded by onlookers.
Meanwhile, an old man also tries to approach Ahmadinejad.
He cries out, "Ahmadinejad, I am hungry!
Ahmadinejad, I am hungry!"
Ahmadinejad keeps smiling and waving as he peers out from the sunroof of the car.
Curiously, while most western media have been talking about the girl, Iranian bloggers focused on the hungry old man.
Karansadr says :
This old man who shouts "I am hungry, I am retired" shows that all of Ahmadinejad's promises were false.
We still remember when he said that Iran is the only country where there is no hunger.
Babak Dad writes :
One day, these people will ask us, "What were you doing when we used to struggle with hunger?"
Do we have an answer?
I have doubts.
Egypt: When Religion Sleeps With Politics · Global Voices
Egyptian blogger Zeinobia attacks Pope Shenouda III in one of her recent posts here, for his Easter speech this year.
Still I feel so sad and angry from what the Pope Shounda said and did this Easter from praying for Mubarak to have longer life !! and warning his people from listening to those vandals over the Internet who will be sent to hell !!??
She continues:
For the Muslims this is something usual ,I know from long time that the speeches of the Emam in the Mosque in our neighbourhood are approved by the security , so I do not care much for what they said , not to mention that the religious men in Islam do not have this holy status of the religious men in Christianity.
But for someone like Pope Shounda in his position comes and says these nonsense about those facebookers who will be roasted in hell , then we need a stand here.
She ends her post with:
There is no excuse for the Pope or the for Sheikh of Al-Azhar in fact I will dare and say that they should fear the Lord not the President
Cyberactivism, blogging and the use of Facebook has recently come under the scrutiny of Egyptian officials, following claims that a nation-wide strike on April 6, which culminated with the Mahalla workers revolt.
Several bloggers as well as the founder of a Facebook group named April 6 were among hundreds of activists, politicians and passer-bys detained by the authorities on the day and the days which followed.
That said, the fact remains that it wasn't the Facebook group which has led to the strike and workers calling for higher wages and better salaries to meet increasing living expenses.
Ethiopian bloggers defend charged pop star · Global Voices
Ethiopian bloggers rushed to the defence of their country's top pop singer Teddy Afro, after he appeared in court charged with the hit-and-run killing of a youth in capital Addis Ababa.
Many writers were convinced Afro was being framed by Ethiopian authorities who, they said, resented the singer's huge popularity and veiled anti-government lyrics.
Afro was first questioned by police in November 2006 after a homeless 18-year-old was killed by a car in the centre of Addis Ababa.
Officers reportedly claimed Afro's BMW had been spotted at the scene by a taxi driver.
His fans were taken by surprise when Afro was arrested, charged and remanded in custody last week, two years after the original incident.
The mainstream media described how fans staged protests outside the court room where a judge decided to postpone a bail hearing.
Teddy Afro - real name Tewodros Kassahun - is hugely popular among Ethiopians in and outside the country.
His hit song Yasteseryal (hear a clip on his official site teddyafro.com) - which many say criticises a line of Ethiopian leaders including current prime minister Meles Zenawi - was reportedly banned on state controlled radio.
Merkato published an entry by Golto Aila titled Ethiopia - "My Solidarity Forum" for Teddy Afro - An Ethiopian Hero & a Prisoner of Conscience which stated:
This advocate of justice for our people; this voice for the voiceless; this champion of the oppressed; this ultimate entertainer could have lived in luxury abroad and enjoyed life as most of us do, but knowing the risk to his own life, he returned home to continue the mission he has set for himself!
Today he sits in the notorious Kaliti Prison, precisely because of what he does for his down-trodden compatriots!
The humiliation he has suffered so far and will continue to suffer hence will be the most poignant symbol of our peoples' suffering for the last two decades!
Debteraw Blog mentioned Afro in a list of "political prisoners" in the entry Tensae Le-Ethiopia.
Addis Tibeb wrote in Teddy Afro arrested:
Many fans believe that Teddy is set up for the charge by the government that is supposed to resent Teddy’s public acceptance in his political reprimands by some of his songs
Arefe of Addis Journal stopped short of describing his own opinion of the case, but described the scenes outside the court in Court adjourns Teddy's hearing:
hundreds of cheering and chanting fans had greeted Teddy's arrival.
Wearing a T-shirt and sunglasses, Teddy waved as he slowly made his way into the courthouse.
As he left the court, the 'free him' shout became more intense and police surrounded and arrested some of them.
A journalist for Hamrawai magazine and another newspaper reporter were among the arrested.
It's unclear why police arrested them.
It was said they are all detained in the police station in front of the court...
Teddy's arrest weeks ago has generated much interest and anxiety in the city and his songs have enjoyed sudden popularity in the bars, taxis and public places.
freeteddyafro left a message on esai the forum run by The Ethiopian Students Association International:
It is hard to know if Teddy's (imprisonment) is motivated by politics or it is a following judicial process.
Teddy is the symbol of Ethiopian new and future generation.
He is a bridge for the past, present and future.
He is an idol for young generation.
Let us bring Teddy to daylight before he disappears forever.
esai commenter Ethiopia said he was convinced Afro was innocent and feared for his chances of a fair trial:
I DONT believe Teddy IS BOTH INHUMAN to leave a dead street kid laying on the ground AND DUMB enough to stay in the country for two years.
Samuel Gebru sounded a lone voice of caution, calling on people not to politicise Afro's case in Ethiopia: Teddy Afro's imprisonment:
Some Ethiopians abroad have tried to capitalize his imprisonment, pending a bail hearing, as the Government's bid to silence the iconic singer...there's a long way ahead before the verdict, so whatever is said abroad is mere speculation.
Nevertheless, the politicization of his arrest is not only false but unhealthy in our developing political climate in Ethiopia.
Bangladesh: Bangla Blogs remember May Day · Global Voices
This week, the Bangla blog world buzzed with essays and analysis regarding May 1st, remembered the world over as International Workers' Day or Labor Day.
There was disappointment amongst many of the bloggers who felt that the day, over time, had perhaps lost its true meaning and was seen as just another holiday.
According to Zukrufa, many employers were paying lip service to the memory of May Day by organizing seminars, sports and magazine articles on the issue and showing the workers a lush dream of what their life could be like.
However, those same employers were not actually making any changes in the way workers were exploited by the system and thereby denied their well-deserved rights.
Syed Amiruzzaman sees this as a ploy to keep the working class deluded so that they can be exploited, not only by the employers, but also by political parties and trade union leaders.
In Amader Kotha (Our stories), a Bangla blog which is part of Narijibon project in Bangladesh (a Rising Voices grantee), Aysha Khatun writes how even today the workers in Bangladesh's garment industry are very much exploited and have to put in minimum 12 hours labor to get paid 8 hours' worth.
Also, these workers, she tells us, are made to work through holidays and probably were working even on May Day.
Kowshik Ahmed points out the plight of workers in various fields and raises a question about their rights and 'job security'.
Blogger Suman Chowdhury however sees hope and says that just as there is exploitation on the one hand, on the other hand there is the indomitable spirit of the labor class and the will to protest and get their rights.
He calls for unity among the workers across the globe.
Kyrgyzstan: An Anxious April · Global Voices
A next to last week of April started from the unexpected fall of temperature.
A lot of bloggers posted the photographs of the frozen greenery and the trees under snow.
Yanagi presented the beautiful photos of the leaves under snow in her blog. red_ptero called this fall of temperature “grimaces of the global warming”.
A fall of temperature has happened not only to nature, but to the Russian-Kyrgyz relations too.
A Russian soldier was heavy injured in an incident between Russian militaries from the Russian airbase in Kant city and the Kyrgyz police.
Many people consider this incident as a threat for the Kyrgyz-Russian relationships.
svetofor_kg told :
The officers from the Russian airbase can be very impudent and would not mind striving for the others' wives and brides.
They consider that Kyrgyzstan is a beachhead where they can do anything without any care about the Kyrgyz laws.
Jeffrey Broman opines:
"Since when have the Kyrgyz police in Bishkek been the least bit concerned with enforcing traffic laws?
I smell a coverup".
An increase of the tariffs for the transport, electricity and heating became another “hot” subject to discuss.
FinalFantazy told :
They will shake out the souls of the ordinary citizens soon.
There will be money only to buy soap and a rope from the pensions and salaries to be hung.
An announcement of the President of Kyrgyzstan Kurmanbek Bakiev that “we can see such a big reduction of the corruption’s level in few places” has aroused indignation among the Kyrgyz blogosphere.
grgreg writes :
Yes, of course.
We can’t see such reduction of the corruption in any state.
The size of the bribes increased two-three times more in last 3 years in Kyrgyzstan.
Such process isn’t called “reduction” in any country…
Recently some politicians suggested equating Internet with Media.
The Kyrgyz bloggers became anxious.
salva08 thinks:
it’s totally ludicrous!
They don’t know anything about IT.
Internet can be tracked, but can’t be controlled.
This is a conclusion of Pentagon in 2005.
Tarantino adds :
Equally well Kyrgyzstan can announce itself a worldwide leader.
Theoretically, Internet can be equated with Media at the legislative level.
But where is a realization?
How can be our jurisdiction applied for the foreign servers?
The domain names in Kyrgyzstan zone don’t belong to the state legally.
Our politicians should stop thinking soviet-union style.
Internet can’t be restricted".
Tajikistan: Electricity in Exchange of Salaries · Global Voices
The mayor of Dushanbe and Chairman of the Tajik Parliament's Upper Chamber Mamadsaid Ubaidulloev proposed a strange way to raise funds for construction of Rogun hydropower station - one of the biggest energy projects in Tajikistan.
He calculated all salaries of the Dushanbe residents and drew a conclusion that if all of the working people in the city give up half of their wages in May and June, it will constitute about $10 million.
The power plant reportedly requires about $1 billion more, but in fact nobody knows the real amount of money necessary for completion of the construction.
The mayor's appeal was a response to the president Rahmon's recent his annual speech in the parliament.
He emphasized the importance of Rogun hydropower station as an asset for energy independence of the state.
Khurshed quotes the president:
"Here I take the opportunity to appeal to each citizen of the country who loves his motherland — and especially to professional constructors and engineers — to take active part in construction and contribute to energy independence of the country".
People hope that it will not turn into "voluntary-compulsory" campaign.
However, not surprisingly, all members of the parliament and those who work in the mayor’s office have already gave up their salaries in a contribution to Rogun.
This raises a fair question: How these people are going to live and feed their families in the next month?
Corruption is, probably, the answer.
The average monthly salary does not exceed $50 - so it is not a big deal to lose one salary but retain a post, which may bring you several times more money.
Perahps, the level of corruption is going to spike in the nearest months.
Khorsheed Bakhshayesh thinks that all other governmental agencies will follow this example:
Observers say that Dushanbe has made such an appeal with a view that the past winter crisis is still fresh in people's memory and could trigger their active participation.
Nevertheless, with 60% of the nation living below the poverty line, the government’s optimism may face lack of enthusiasm among masses.
Khorsheed also gives an interesting fact:
It is not the first government’s appeal to the nation for charity.
In 1990s many citizens of Tajikistan contributed to the Sangtuda-1 dam construction, but the concrete figures were never revealed.
75 % of the construction is now funded by the Russian monopoly RAO-UES.
Just to remind — the construction of Sangtuda-1 is still not completed.
Only one turbine was launched this winter, as others are expected to be launched by the end of this year.
Darvish is ironic about the mayor's initiative and says that it would be better if the officials sacrifice money from their bank accounts rather than beg for $10 mln from the poor people.
However he is afraid that the people will not say “no”:
The people of Tajikistan are friendly; they never say “no” if someone asks them for something. Tajikistan is a heaven for beggars.
How can they turn this one out of doors?
Haiti: finding relief for hunger in children · Global Voices
The international food shortage and crisis is doing its rounds on the blogosphere, and videos are no exception.
From Haiti: people eating dirt to survive, and a plan to help feed the hungry Haitian children.
Haiti is the poorest country in the American continent, and hunger for them has been an important issue since before this crisis took to the headlines.
In YouTube, toddgsapp shows us a video of the process by which a family makes mud cakes, not only to eat themselves, but also to sell.
These dirt cookies or mud cakes are made out of dirt, shortening and salt, and is sometimes their only means of sustenance.
Food for thought, isn't it?
However, it seems that most seem aware of the problem, but there is precious few that we can do to help out. lovinitwithhim uploaded a video on the Haitian Food crisis for Kids Against Hunger you can see here.
With the following Current TV video by robhill_productions for Meds and Food for Kids (MFK) in Haiti we are given an insight into an NGO seeking and testing a possible solution for malnutrition in children, based on a high energy peanut butter product that is ready to use and to be given to the children.
This boosted peanut butter is said to contain peanuts, powdered milk, sugar, oil, vitamins and minerals and is produced locally using Haitian peanuts harvested from local farmers and all the other supplements are purchased locally as well, helping the economy.
According to MFK, it costs $68 for a full dosage of the ready to use therapeutic food, or Medikal Mamba as it is known locally, to be given to a child and bring them back to life.
Taiwan: What can a baseball do? · Global Voices
There are some Taiwanese playing in Major League Baseball: Chin-Feng Chen in Dodgers from 2002-2005, Chin-Lung Hu in Dodgers, Hong-Chih Kuo in Dodgers, Chin-Hui Tsao in Royals, and Chien-Ming Wang in Yankees.
Although they are loved by Taiwanese, these baseball stars are not the focus of this article.
Here are stories about how baseballs change the life of challenged people and students in remote elementary schools.
Photo courtesy of Haomei.
The first story starts when a screen writer, an actor, and a director, Nien-Jen Wu left a message in Haomei's blog about the Sacred Heart Home for the challenged people.
Fr.
Franz Burkhardt founded the Sacred Heart Home in Chia-Yi, Taiwan, in 1980, and he planned to build a larger building to help more challenged people.
Although the Reverend Franz Burkhardt, a recipient of presidential and papal honors for his services to Taiwan over almost half a century, died in 2002, his colleagues keep working on this project.
Due to the funding shortage, Haomei started to blog about the Sacred Heart Home and helps raise money and invite people to visit the Sacred Heart Home.
An episode for these fund-raising activities is about baseballs.
Chensumi talked about how Tai-Yuan Kuo signed baseballs for a fund-raising auction:

China: The Green Olympics and an Actress as UN Eco Ambassador. · Global Voices
Dan Beekman at "Blogging Beijing" gives a roundup of Beijing's environmental problems and its hopes.
He interviews NGO and student leaders about the Green Olympics, one of the three themes of this year's Games.
He 's also recently interviewed Mr. Wu Dengming, an environmental powerhouse from Chongqing, in middle China.
Mr. Wu had this to say about the end of the Games:
After the Olympics, this movement will continue.
China can't go back.
Now people know what needs to happen.
Organizations like ours are starting to play a bigger role in society.
UNESCO leader Gaoming Jiang talks about Beijing's massive water problems on China Dialogue.
Beijing's waterways suffer from pollution (a cocktail of fertilizers and even excrement), and a severe lack of water.
He also has some expert opinions on cleaning up, with the concluding suggestion being
... ecological management must be linked to poverty alleviation and wealth creation.
The challenges faced in protecting water sources are manmade problems.
We should take the initiative by helping these areas solve energy problems with methane production technology and a more distributed infrastructure.
We must also help with hygiene by building waste and water treatment plants.
This will ensure the areas have adequate vegetation coverage, produce enough water, and it will guarantee that the water flowing into reservoirs is clean.
At Treehugger, Alex Pasternack comments on the U.N. Development Program's decision to make a Chinese celebrity National Goodwill Ambassador to promote the environment.
Actress Zhou Xun starred in Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress and the moving Chinese movie Suzhou River.
He says...
In a country where the rhetoric on environmental protection seems inversely proportionate to public awareness (especially among young people!), celebrity environmentalism may be one of the more effective ways to get the message out.
And aside from fur-wearing Gong Li (or Leo, on a recent stop in Hong Kong), few stars in China have become known for their green choices.
Too bad.
Star-powered campaigns can be a relief from the typical government initiatives...
Russia: "The March, Sort Of" · Global Voices
The Russian opposition was to hold a protest rally on May 6 in Moscow, on the eve of Dmitry Medvedev's inauguration as president Vladimir Putin's replacement, but city officials refused to allow it - and leaders of the oppositional coalition, the Other Russia, ended up canceling the Dissenters' March at the last minute.
Dozens of protesters were detained by police anyway.
LJ user drugoi, a top-ranking Russian blogger, posted photos as well as this description (RUS) of "the march, sort of":
This evening, by the monument to Griboedov at Chistye Prudy, 4,625 journalists and 8,416 policemen were waiting for the participants of the Dissenters' March, who, however, showed up from the opposite direction.
A small group of 15-20 people gathered at Pokrovka and moved along Chistye Prudy towards the subway station, accompanied by a few photographers and cameramen.
The police saw the group from afar and stopped it near the monument to a Kazakh .
Just as I heard "grrrr... self-control and calmness... grhm-hm-gr..." coming through static noise from one riot cop's walkie-talkie, the opposition walking down the path were attacked from all sides.
LJ user kozenko posted an epitaph (RUS) to the Other Russia:
There was no Dissenters' March.
The leaders vanished, and the activists carried out several small-scale and brief public disturbances in the city.
Well, the Other Russia, congratulations on your demise.
Last year, it was fun with you, and even interesting.
And at the start it even seemed that there was a future. But the finale turned out to be - forgive me - boring and embarrassing.
Amen.
Here is one exchange from the comment section to this post:
marchenk:
This post sounds like something written by an offended and disappointed viewer. As if you had bought tickets for this show. And the troupe ran away with you money. :)
kozenko: This posts sounds like something written by an offended and disappointed person.
Very disappointed, because none of the politicians in this country represents his interests.
Malaysia: Vigil for jailed blogger Raja Petra this evening · Global Voices
Take note of what's been happening in Malaysia these past few days since popular blogger and political commentator Raja Petra Kamarudin, 58, was imprisoned on Tuesday after a trial which saw him charged with sedition for having written a blog post.
If the Malaysian government was truly worried about bloggers effecting social unrest, now they have it.
Remember, this is a country where any politician worth their mutton—Jeff Ooi was one of several Malaysians who rode their blog and calls for reform to Parliament in recent elections—has a blog, and even the old goats now blog too.
Ex-Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad has a highly-read blog, as does PM hopeful Anwar Ibrahim.
"They set up their blogs, and they try to close down our blogs."
Raja is one of the sharpest voices both online and off in Malaysia, so it's highly suggested you check out his statements to the public right after his sentencing, vlogged by Malaysian citizen media stronghold, Malaysiakini.
Raja Petra (or RPK) has had his case brought to parliament, where MP-bloggers are calling RPK's arrest politically-motivated retaliation sought by the current ruling coalition following its heavy losses in recent elections, elections that saw for the first time popular bloggers winning seats, on a platform of increased transparency and post-colonial racial integration.
As the Malaysia Star points out, this is the first time that a blogger has been charged under the Sedition Act, and RPK now faces a fine of up to just over USD 1,500 and/or three years in prison.
The trial, which saw businessman Syed Akbar Ali charged with sedition for a comment he left on RPK's blog, appears to have been carried out with no clarification given as to which part of the Act RPK had supposedly violated.
Multi-ethnic reform lobby group Aliran looks at the text of the Sedition Act, and expresses shock that this led to anything more than a defamation charge.
As of Thursday morning, RPK's readers have raised online far more than what he stands to be fined, and also today comes news that Raja Petra is on a hunger strike, and refusing to meet even with his own wife.
Following a candlelight vigil held outside Sungai Buloh prison last night, another vigil will be held at 8pm this evening in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
A Facebook group that has been set up to call for RKP's release is buzzing today, and a whole set of images can be found there, among other places, for anyone who wants to put a badge on their blog to show their support:
At the center of all this is still the murder of Mongolian former model and polyglot Altantuya; Raja Petra's blog post calling for justice in her death to be resolved has been posted widely in recent days; here's how it begins:
Today, we shall not be talking about politics.
We shall also not be talking about race or religion.
Today, we shall talk about doing the human thing.
Today, let’s discuss how to launch a ‘Justice for Altantuya: restore Malaysia’s dignity’ campaign.
And let’s send those bastards who murdered Altantuya to hell where they belong.
An invitation was extended earlier to Mr. Kamarudin to come speak at this year's Global Voices Advocacy summit to be held in Budapest this June, and remains extended now.

A Global Voices Guide to re:publica Berlin 2012 · Global Voices
This week (May 2-4, 2012) thousands of minds will join in Berlin, Germany at the annual gathering aimed at exchanging knowledge and ideas called re:publica (#rp12).
Those physically present will be able to attend lectures, debates and nightly parties.
Last year the re:publica conference had over 3,000 attendees, and almost a hundred thousand viewers of the webcast.
Even more are expected this year.
The motto for "Germany’s largest and most prominent conference on the future of our society and all things digital" this year is ACT!ON.
A number of Global Voices (GV) community members will participate in over 200 hours of scheduled program, on 8 separate stages in 14 tracks.
Solana Larsen, GV managing editor, who presented Global Voices at re:publica 2011 "in an auditorium that holds more than 1000 people!" reckons:
In Germany, it's a conference that really speaks for the Internet scene and has a clear influence on the political discourse here.
Claire Ulrich, editor of Global Voices in French and a member of GV Board of Directors, explains:
For us European netizens, Berlin is the center and driving force of hackers' culture, the "free" culture, in short, our European "innovation hub". re:publica in Berlin is a showcase of international trends, but also of this hacker culture that will be essential in the recession and political crisis we are in, and a great opportunity to meet those future movers and shakers.
When can you hear Global Voices people speak?
Ivan Sigal, GV executive director, will speak together with Solana on May 2 (13:30 CET) in a session called "Joining Forces" about the driving forces behind the rise of citizen media, and if individual acts of online activism in countries that are far from each other together can be considered a “global movement”.
Ivan will also speak with Bjarke Myrthu of Storyplanet.com on May 3 (11:15 CET) about "New directions in visual storytelling".
Ivan thinks that re:publica is important because...
...It seems to be expanding beyond Germany and even Europe in terms of its reach and influence.
I also like that it has an open-ended and democratic feeling.
Jillian York, GV author, member of GV Board of Directors, and EFF director of international freedom of expression, will speak on May 3 (13:45) about Threats to Free Expression in the Middle East and North Africa.
A re:publica veteran, she said:
re:publica was one of the best conferences I attended last year - the unique mix of participants, as well as the pertinent topics.
The panel "From Dissent to Disillusionment?" hosted in cooperation with Deutsche Welle, will focus on Syria, Egypt, Tunisia in "A Critical Assessment of the Media Landscape After the Arab Spring" on May 3 (15:00 CET) and will feature 3 GV'ers: Leila Nachawati of Spain/Syria, Claire Ulrich, and Tarek Amr of Egypt.
They will speak on a panel with international journalist Zulfikar Abbany.
Claire Ulrich and Tarek Amr are also participating in the jury of this year's the Best of Blogs Awards.
Tarek says:
I am part of the jury this year, and I used to follow the competition since its beginning.
I love how despite it covers about 11 languages, it doesn't only stick to that but there are also verticals, topics, ranging from video blogs, to blogs for human rights to the use of technology for social change, which shows how they aren't limiting themselves to blogs only and how also the are creating competition within certain languages as well as worldwide between blogs from different languages.
On May 4 (11:15 CET) Markos Lemma will speak about Blogging in Ethiopia.
He considers the conference "a big scale meet-up for people who are engaging on citizen media and create a physical nexus point for connections," and adds:
It is my first time to re:publica and Berlin.
I am excited to represent the Ethiopian bloggers and talk a little bit about them.
Besides the speakers, other members of the GV network attending re:publica include Berlin residents Kasia Odrozek and Débora Medeiros, as well as outlanders Paula Goes, Emma Brewin, Katrin Zinoun, Suzanne Lehn, Bernardo Parrella , Janet Gunter, and Rayna St., who echoed a wider sentiment when she wrote:
This year's edition will be held in the middle of quite a battle: we had SOPA/PIPA in the US that saw massive protest again and the same happened to ACTA which, I hope, will not be ratified.
In the meantime, numerous countries impose various restrictive regulations on their own. re:publica 2012 will gather speakers with wide range of experience, backgrounds and standpoints which will definitely help (me) to make better sense of what is happening and what is to come.
Also attending will be Adil Nurmakov and Filip Stojanovski, who are participating in the Blogger Tour 2012, a public diplomacy initiative at the invitation of the German Federal Foreign Office.

China: 7.8 scale earthquake felt across most of China · Global Voices
Around two hours ago, an earthquake registering 7.8 on the Richter scale struck in southwestern China's Sichuan province, centered in Wenchuan county, and with tremors felt as far away as Beijing and Hong Kong.
Update, Tuesday 9am: QQ has been aggregating video shot by its users from many of the affected areas; many of these videos can be seen here. The video below comes from user Gary, taken in an unspecified location: The earthquake was reportedly felt in Beijing, Tianjin, Chongqing, parts of Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Gansu, Henan, Ningxia and Jiangsu.
See below for updates by region.

Macedonian Journalists Protest Death Threats · Global Voices
Several journalists spoke at a protest in Skopje about the recent threats directed at journalist Borjan Jovanovski, holding the funeral wreath that had been delivered to his home as a death threat in April 2015.
Photo by Vanco Dzambaski, used with permission.
Borjan Jovanovski, a prominent Macedonian news anchor, received a funeral wreath at his home on April 21. "Final Farewell," read the message on the wreath.
Jovanovski works for the independent news website Nova TV and is a well-known critic of Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski's conservative government.
The wreath had been delivered directly to his wife.
Jovanovski duly reported the incident to police as a death threat, but the odds of finding the perpetuator are slim.
According to recent ratings by the World Press Freedom Index and others, Macedonia's press freedom has been ranked "the worst in the Balkans" and threats and questionable defamation suits against journalists are becoming more common.
On April 22, several journalists in Macedonia demonstrated against the threat to Jovanovski, linking the incident to the country's deepening political crisis.
Also on April 22, journalist Zoran Bojarovski received death threats via Facebook and reported them to police, who promptly launched an investigation.
OSCE Representative for Media Freedom Dunja Mijatović has called on the authorities to investigate the wreath sent to Jovanovski's home, noting that several groups have joined in condemning the threat, including the opposition SDSM political party, the Journalists’ Plenum, the Macedonian Institute for Media, the Agency for Audio and Audio-Visual Media Services, and both national journalists' associations AJM and MAN. Mijatović called on the Macedonian government to reverse the country's apparent trend of deteriorating press freedom.
Recent developments include the conviction and subsequent parole of journalist Tomislav Kezarovski, the public labeling of another journalist, Jadranka Kostova, as an informant for foreign espionage agencies, and allegations that the government wiretapped the phones of more than 100 journalists.
The Journalists' Association of Macedonia (ZNM) and the Macedonian Media Institute (MIM) also condemned the death threats, accusing state institutions of promoting an atmosphere of intolerance toward criticism of the government and politicians.
ZNM called it a "cowardly act directed against all journalists in Macedonia," adding that this "incident is a consequence of the spreading of hate speech in media inspired by the conduct of the political parties."
ZNM highlighted that state institutions have so far failed to solve a single case where a journalist suffered violence, verbal threats, or hate speech. Follow our in-depth coverage: Macedonians Demand ‘a New Beginning’

Investigative Journalists Report on Macedonian Government Official's Hidden Wealth · Global Voices
The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP), together with Macedonian Nova TV and the Czech Center for Investigative Journalism published an investigative piece about the amassed wealth of the head of Macedonian Secret Service Sasho Mijalkov, who also happens to be a first cousin to the current Prime Minister of Macedonia.
Among other things, the article cites:
Mijalkov belongs to a small clique of men who run Macedonia – men that include his cousin and best man.
Meanwhile, under his leadership, his agency has been criticized for dodging oversight, failing to meet European Union standards and for intruding in places it should not.
This career government official owns number of businesses and properties in Macedonia and Czech Republic, where his father Jordan Mijalkov (1933-1991) hеld the position of manager of a foreign trade company during socialist Yugoslavia.
The Mijalkov-Gruevski political dynasty has held power during much of Macedonia's transition.
Jordan Mijalkov was the first Minister of Interior after the country gained independence, until his death in car crash.
His sister's son Nikola Gruevski was Minister of Finance (1999-2002) and Prime Minister (2006-2014).
The son, Sasho Mijalkov, who is seen as the grey eminence behind the family "throne", served in Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito's Honor Guard alongside his brother as military policemen , and has held high positions in the ministries of Defense and Interior of Macedonia since 1998.
He was a protagonist in a recent story covered by Global Voices, regarding the use of a defamation lawsuit as a means of punishment and intimidation against independent media.

Serbia: International Day Against Homophobia · Global Voices
On the International Day Against Homophobia, marked on May 17, a Serbian lesbian human rights organization Labris has issued a statement.
Jasmina Tesanovic, a Serbian political activist and writer, re-posted the text of the statement on her B92 blog.
Below is the translation from Serbian:
: Homosexuality is not an illness.
Homosexuality is not an illness, according to the Serbian Medical Association's response to a request from Labris to check the official conclusion of the .
On May 17, the International Day Against Homophobia - and as part of the "Are you a Homophobe?" initiative - Labris has turned again to SMA, the Serbian Medical Chamber and the future health minister.
Labris expects the new minister to immediately declare that homosexuality is not an illness.
Labris also expects the adoption of an ethics code about sexual orientation by the Serbian Medical Chamber, to help prevent discrimination against persons in need of medical care.
We remember that Labris - the organization for lesbian human rights - has been persistently trying this year to get numerous institutions, including the ministry of health, to issue a statement of agreement with WHO.
One of the relevant domestic institutions - SMA - has expressed agreement with WHO.
In this way, Labris wants to support other associations to join us in action of stamping out prejudices.
May 17 is the day of promotion of lesbian and gay rights, because on this day in 1990 WHO officially took homosexuality off the list of mental illnesses.

The attacks won't be too powerful.
Everyone is afraid of doctors, because everyone has to deal with them one day.
Kuwait: Sad for Shaikh Saad · Global Voices
Former Kuwaiti ruler Shaikh Saad Al Abdulla Al Sabah died today after a long illness at the age of 78.
Kuwait's online community was moved by the news, as hundreds of messages of sympathy and condolences poured onto blogs, in Arabic and English.
The country has declared three days of official mourning - but the parliamentary elections, scheduled for Saturday, will go ahead as planned.
Saba posts the following eulogy: الذي ضحى بحياته وكرسها دائما وابدا من اجل الدفاع عن تراب هذه الارض
وكان رحمة الله عليه علامة بارزة في تاريخ الكويت المعاصر
كقائد عظيم يشار عليه بالبنان
وذلك من خلال البطولات التى تصدى لها
في فترة تقلدة مراكز السيادة والحكم في دولتنا الحبييه
We are hurt by the loss of a great man from Kuwait, who sacrificed his life and spent it always to defend this land.
He was, may Allah rest his soul in peace, a major personality in Kuwait's contemporary history.
He was a great leader, with heroic deeds which everyone knows about during his official work and rule in our beloved country.
Mr Chocolate too is overcome with emotions and writes: و والداً لأهل الكويت
لن ننسى فضلك و جهدك في تحرير الكويت
و لن ننسى انك كنت أحد أبناء أبو الدستور الشيخ عبدالله السالم الصباح
ربما حكمتنا أيام و لكن لن ننسى معاناتك مع المرض
رحمكم الله جميعاً يا أوفياء الكويت
You have always been a pillar of strength for your brother, the Emir of Hearts, Shaikh Jaber Al Ahmad Al Jaber Al Sabah, may Allah rest his soul in peace.
You have been a father for the people of Kuwait.
We will never forget your efforts in liberating Kuwait and we will never forget that you have been one of the sons of the father of the Kuwaiti constitution Shaikh Abdulla Al Salem Al Sabah.
You may have been a ruler for a few days but we will never forget your suffering with illness.
May Allah have mercy on all the faithful people of Kuwait.

India: Jaipur blasts, Terrorism and the Government · Global Voices
On 13th May, serial blasts rocked Jaipur.
Reports suggest that more than sixty people were killed, and another 150 were injured.
MyZone writes about Jaipur, which as a city has been relatively peaceful, and the sheer panic the blasts created.
Disbelief turned into shock as over the fifteen minutes the number rose from two to five, and the magnitude of what had happened started sinking in.
For the first time in its almost three century old history had Jaipur been terrorized.
Cell phones started buzzing with anxious parents and relatives enquiring about our whereabouts and asking us to return home immediately.
We were among the fortunate few whose calls managed to go through.
As the clock ticked, the networks became jammed.
The lounge emptied within minutes, and a place buzzing with youngsters had a deserted look in no time.
While terrorism is not new to India, and various cities have seen terrorist attacks, Jaipur has never been attacked on this scale before.
The blasts have exposed the vulnerability of cities and its citizens, and the failure of intelligence.
There are hints that the attacks were coordinated by "other countries".
A blogger from Pakistan expresses solidarity and hopes that the Indian Government doesn't rush through things and point fingers at Pakistan.
Ha's Blog expresses concern for team members in Jaipur.
There were some signs that our colleagues were afraid that we from the Dutch side would consider Jaipur to be less safe because all of this.
But I see it as my responsibility to show our Jaipur team that we are committed to support them, as they are one of us!
Hindustaniat takes a closer look at why Jaipur was a target for the attacks.
Jaipur is one of the foremost symbol of India's cultural heritage.
Lakhs of tourists come to the Pink City every year and Rajasthan is the face of Indian tourism worldwide, along with Agra.
The anti-national forces must have been desperate as there was no major communal or casteist issue in the country for long.
Indian Muslims writes about the failure of the government to resolve previous terrorist attacks.
One of the reasons the government is so ill-prepared to either prevent or solve such terrorist attacks is that there is no follow-up on the previous such attacks.
Case in point: Mecca Masjid Blasts.
Andhra Pradesh government constituted an inquiry commission under Justice Bhaskara Rao in June 2007 to submit its report on the incident within three months.
It has been more than 11 months since then and we didn’t hear anything.
Off Stumped voices similar concerns about government inaction and apathy.
Cynical Indian emphasizes that people need to be more vigilant.
DJ Fadereu twitters updates from Jaipur.
A group on Facebook is discussing the events as they unfold.
The flipside of the solidarity that is expressed across the blogosphere is that some people appear to be jumping to vitriol.
Some of the message boards in the main stream media have been filled with allegations against Muslims.
Ecuador: President Correa Criticized During European Visit · Global Voices
Correa in a crowded march in Guayquil during January 19th, 2008 - Photo by Charlie Perez and used under a Creative Commons license.
Last week we reported that Ecuadoran President Rafael Correa was received warmly in Spain and proved to have a different relationship with the King of Spain, and did not necessarily follow the lead of Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez, as has been reported.
Yet, Correa encountered plenty of criticism from members of the crowds for his apparent inaction on the demands of the immigrant community and for his anti-Colombia rhetoric.
One of the most notable incident was recorded on video after a meeting at the House of the Americas in Spain in the presence of 1500 people.
Correa was publicly criticized by an Ecuadoran immigrant, who claimed that the president has not been paying attention to the demands of the immigrant community.
As the president was leaving, he called out to the man and said, "because of idiots like you, the entire Ecuadoran community looks bad"
This unprofessional behavior drew the criticism of the Ecuadoran media and bloggers, as well as members of the Constituent Assembly.
Dionicio Cando , a member of the Constituent Assembly for the Morona Santiago province refers to an article written by well know Ecuadoran journalism Carlos Vera, who asks who will incarcerate Correa for such an insult to the immigrant:
Tajikistan: The power of gossip · Global Voices
Recently, the Uzbek website UzMetronom disseminated information about possible murder of Hasan Sadulloev, the bother-in-law of Tajik President Rahmon.
Hasan is considered to be one of the wealthiest and powerful persons in today's Tajikistan.
According to the website, Hasan was shot by his nephew on May 2 and died in a German hospital on May 8.
This information was picked up by many other respected information agencies and subsequently by bloggers.
For the last two weeks it was one of the main topics of discussions in the Tajik society.
However, it still remains on the level of gossips and no one has credible information to either prove or disapprove this.
Everybody is interested in getting information about this story.
Tojvar says that Hasan is the most popular person in Tajiksitan :
Thousands of people everyday are looking for news about him and discuss his possible murder.
Several media outlets are having ready articles with different opinions and various further scenarios, all counting the days when the rumors come true or false.
Ian at Beyond the River links the story of Hasan to his business, with the most lucrative part of it being Talco, the aluminum smelter factory:
RFE/RL quotes some loyal employees who claim that they saw him “just a half-hour ago” and that “thank god, he is in good health.”
In another post Ian continues watching this story by translating excerpts of a post from from Tajik-language Andesha, and tries to show what kind of conversations might take place around kitchen tables all over Tajikistan:
I don’t believe these stories, but I have a few questions.
Why didn’t Rahmon attend the May 9 celebration for the first time in history of our independent country.
Why didn’t Hassan Sadullayev travel to Kazakhstan with Rahmon?
Why is the state not trying to disprove the rumors by showing the healthy body of Sadullayev to the people?”
Srasov, a journalist from Kazakhstan reports in his blog that the news about possible murder of Hasan might be “fake” to discredit the visit of Rahmon to Kazakhstan.
As I was assured in the Embassy of Tajikistan it was a false information, disseminated on the Internet by the “enemies of the president” aiming to undermine his reputation.
It has no relation to reality, they said.
neweurasia also says that most probably it was a “fake” aimed to destabilize political situation in the country.
The author does not have clear evidences, but relies upon the discussions he had with his friends and colleagues.
I hope that Hasan is alive, because the death of such person does not remain without consequences.
I think that this information was disseminated against the information about Talco and the legal fees for the proceedings in order to destabilize the political situation in the country.
Since Hasan is one of the main actors in this process, the story about his death would be an excellent accelerator in political destabilization.
If the gossip comes out to be false, it would be the “top lie of the year", cited by all media outlets in Tajikistan. Also posted on neweurasia
Moldova, Turkey: Natalya Morar's Istanbul Airport Adventure · Global Voices
Last December, journalist Natalia Morar was barred from entering Russia and deported to her native Moldova after a Russian weekly magazine published a series of her stories about alleged siphoning of huge sums of money out of Russia by the country's high-ranking officials (a GV translation on Morar's ordeal is here).
Earlier this month, Morar (LJ user natmorar) had a bizarre experience at Istanbul International Atatürk Airport, which she has described (RUS) on her blog:
"You are barred from entering the country, you'll be deported back to Moldova now," a Turkish border control officer at Atatürk Airport in Istanbul explained to me in broken English, passing my documents to a promptly summoned policeman.
I was beginning to believe that this was my fate: airports, deportations.
They took me to a police station, held me there for about 40 minutes.
Turned out they had a 24-year-old Natalia Morar in their database, a prostitute who had been previously deported to Moldova.
It took me a long time to explain that I'm not her and that she's not me.
My press card and all other documents just made them even more distrustful.
They must've been thinking: "What a smart prostitute, got herself shielded with documents."
It all ended well when the cops decided to compare our ID numbers.
They let me out , asking by way of good-bye: "Turkish boyfriend, yes?"
Sudan: Sami al-Hajj Released, Khartoum Attacked · Global Voices
This round-up highlights the two most talked about recent topics in the Sudanese blogosphere.
Let's get started with the release of the Sudanese al-Jazeera journalist Sami al-Hajj from Guantanamo Bay where he was held for six years without trial.
Eman was evidently happy:
I’ve held a very simple position on this matter.
Give the man a fair trial, and if he’s found guilty, lock him up behind bars for as long as possible.
If he is found innocent, release him as soon as possible.
That’s it.
Full stop.
Is that too much to ask?
Amjad blogged about Sami's release but then removed his post for a vague reason stated below:
I just want to point out that the post of Sami Al-Hajj's interview which I posted 2 nights ago is now removed.
The post took another path other than the one it was opened for, and hence I thought it would be best to close it to avoid that path it was not opened for.
We believe that Sami Al-Hajj was released on humanitarian basis and we should all just hope that the entire world lives in peace regardless of race, religion or politics.
Thanks. :)
Daana, just like Eman, was also happy after hearing the news of the release:
Sami al Hajj is free....after 6 years in Guantanamo Bay
I haven't been this happy in a while
And now, let's move on to the news about the attacks on Khartoum, Sudan's capital.
Drima blogged a thorough coverage of what happened:
The Darfurian rebel group Justice and Equality Movement mounted a bold attack on Khartoum less than two days ago but was stopped at the outskirts of the city by the Sudanese Armed Forces.
It was a big battle involving helicopters and significant aerial bombardment.
... There are very mixed and heated Sudanese sentiments over this daring move with some (mainly the Southern Sudanese and some Darfurians) staunchly supporting it and others against it.
As for me, I strongly condemn the attack.
The United States and the UN have condemned it too.
I’m glad they’ve made it clear they won’t accept this kind of behavior.
It undermines all efforts aimed at implementing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement and finding a political solution for Darfur.
Andrew Heavens, a freelance writer based in Khartoum made a nice list of the possible reasons behind the attack:
A bloody PR move to get JEM some headlines Retribution – to bring some of Darfur's suffering to Khartoum Humiliation of Khartoum and exposure of holes in its security system Chad-backed revenge for the two Khartoum-backed rebel raids on N'Djamena The move of a mad, power-hungry warlord A move to break the stalemate in the Darfur peace process AKA Operation Longarm Distraction while JEM prepares for an offensive on El Geneina A genuine coup attempt The first stages of a coup attempt to test for support among army and opposition Creating chaos in the capital leading to the breakdown of the state
Kizzie demanded that the government steps down!
The rebels are in the capital.
Yes, innocent civilians are going to die and destroying the capital is not going to help the crises in Darfur in anyway, but it was going to happen...sooner or later.
What to do?
We need a transitional government right now, Bashir needs to STEP DOWN!
Hand over the power to a transitional government for the next year, until the 2009 elections.
If the government doesn't take this seriously and implement the darfur peace agreement, the whole country is going to collapse.
If the concerned international community cares about Sudan, they should pressure the government to step down.
She also posted the following pictures of the aftermath of the attack:

Saudi Arabia: Dhahran Under Siege · Global Voices
Saudi Arabia hosted the Gulf Cooperation Council's Summit in its Eastern province, bringing the leaders of Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, Oman and the UAE under one roof - and holding the residents of Dhahran and Dammam hostage for the duration of their meeting as all the main highways leading to and from the city were shut.
Saudi blogger Ibrahim broke the story early yesterday saying: غلقت أبوابها في وجه أهاليها وزوارها
الأبناء في المدارس عالقين
الأباء خلف الجدران متلهفين لإحتضان أبنائهم
أنوار الشرطه في كل الأنحاء
يا الله ماذا ألم بنا؟؟
اللهم الطف بنا
Dhahran is now completely shut off and no one is able to get to it.
Its gates are shut on its residents and visitors.
Our children are stuck in their schools.
Parents are standing behind the walls, eager to hug their children.
The lights of police cars are everywhere.
Oh my God!
What has happened to us?
May Allah have mercy on us.
Hours later, a much more relaxed Ibrahim explains what had happened: طيب ما تقولون كذا من أول؟ خرعتونا يا جماعة الخير :???:
شوفو اللي صار ..
الحفل يبداء الساعه 4
تم اغلاق الطرقات من الساعه 12 ظهراً
طبعاً أي كبري او منفذ في منطقة الظهران تم اغلاقه … حتى اللي مايؤدي الى أرامكو
تم اغلاق الطرقات حتى الساعه السابعه يمكن
والعالم تدور في مكانها وكل الطرقات مسكره
يعني باختصار .. حسيت باللي يحسون فيه اهل غزه ..كان الله في عونهم
المشكله مو في اللي زارونا
المشكله في المسؤليين في ادارة المرور
واللي انا بديت اشك انهم من اهل الشرقيه … لأنهم مايعرفون يدبرون عمرهم
وش بيصير يعني لو انك قفلت طريق الظهران من أوله من جهة طريق الجبيل
قفلته قبل لا يمر الموكب بربع ساعه … يالله خلنا نقول ساعه
وبعد مايمر الموكب بربع ساعه تفتح كل الطرقات
وبعدها قفل الطريق قبل لا يطلعون من حفلهم بربع ساعه وخلاص
هذا في حال انه كان قصدهم تفادي الازدحام المروري
لكن اللي شفته امس ماكان علشان هالسبب ..
لأنهم مقفلين كل المنطقه بقطر 15 كيلو تقريباً
من طريق ابو حدريه الى كبري القاعده الجويه
يعني أهالي المنطقه الشرقيه اللي يرحبون في الضيوف ( زي ما تقول اللوح الإعلانيه )
حتى سيارات الضيوف ماشافوها
What has happened is that they closed the roads for the GCC kings and leaders who are coming.
Fine, why didn't you tell us this was happening from the beginning?
You really scared us.
See what happened.
The meeting begins at 4pm.
They closed all the roads from noon.
All the exits and flyovers to Dhahran were of course shut, even those leading to (Saudi oil company) Aramco and remained shut until about 7pm.
People were driving around in circles and all the roads were closed.
In short, I felt what the people of Gaza feel, may Allah be of help to them.
The problem wasn't because of our visitors.
The problem was with the officials at the Traffic Directorate, who I don't think belong to the area, because they don't seem to be able to think.
What would have happened if they had closed the Dhahran road in the direction of Jubeil for a quarter of an hour - let's even say an hour - before the convoys pass and then again closed it for a quarter of an hour before the meeting was over?
They would have done this if their reason was to overcome traffic congestion but what I saw yesterday wasn't because of traffic... because they had cordoned off the entire region covering a 15km diameter - from Abu Hadriya Road to the flyover next to the air force base.
This means that the people of the Eastern province, who are expected to welcome guests, did not even get to see their guest's cars. The blogger adds: أنا عن نفسي بديت أمل و أكره هالمناسبات .. لأنه مامنها فايده إلا للحراميه لأنهم بينبسطون .. كل الدوريات والشرطه مع الاحتفال ومخلين الديره تحترق
لا الشعب بيشوفون الملك عبدالله … وبتتسكر عليهم كل الطرقات
I personally am starting to get fed up of and hate such occasions .. because they are useless to everyone except the thieves - who become happy with the knowledge that all the policemen are busy with the ceremony - leaving the entire country at risk.
The people too won't get a chance to meet their king, and all the roads will be closed on them.
Ibrahim too shares the following suggestion to oil giant Saudi Aramco, which is celebrating its centennial this year: فيها مطار وفيها كل شئ .. ولا راح يحتاجون انهم يقفلون طرق ولا شئ
وماراح يتغير شئ … راح يكون الحفل موجود والضيوف موجودين وماراح يكون فيه شعب
يعني جميع الأمور موجوده…. يعني ماتحسون بالحفل الا تسوون زحمه للعالم؟
I suggest to Aramco to hold a ceremony at the Empty Quarter desert to mark its centennial.
There is an airport there and it is well equipped with everything.
They won't have to close the roads or do anything and nothing will change at all - the party will be there, the guests will be there and the public won't be there.
This means that all that they want will be there.
We won't feel there is a party and you will not mess up people's lives.
Kuwait: Speeding Foreigners Unwelcome · Global Voices
A new traffic law which ejects foreign traffic violators from the country, is creating waves in Kuwait.
While one blogger asks what the fuss is about when other countries have already implemented similar rules, another argues that the new clampdown is too strict.
Forzaq8 tells those complaining about the new traffic law that they got what they wanted - after years of asking why Kuwait can't be like the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
Forzaq8 explains:
Who hasn’t heard this or some of its variations ?
” We want to be like the UAE ”
I’m totally sick of it , i hear it a lot , why not the USA ? or Japan ?
Well now we do something like the UAE and people are complaining
Fonzy thinks the law is unfair - with deportation being too strict a punishment.
He notes:
I have full respect and completely support how the ministry is doing its best to impose traffic laws in Kuwait.
But at times, I think they are overdoing it with the penalties.
Just read an article on Arab Times about expats who fail to respect the traffic rules.
Apparently, now they can be deported if they jump a red light and have previous traffic violations… in other words, 2 strikes and you’re out! (...) (P)ersonally, I think deportation is too extreme.
Fining them or jailing them was too much already.
How about by revoking his license as a start.
Still on the topic of traffic, Buzberry posts a table of traffic violations and the fines they carry, while Marzouq of Z District is angry that officials closed off entire stretches of highways to traffic to ferry foreign officials attending a conference in the country.
An exasperated Marzouq explains:
There was no notification what so ever of this traffic or that the police were going to be blocking off roads.
I read the newspapers and there was no mention of this, there is a meeting in Bayan Palace with people coming from out of state.
This caused havoc on the roads of Kuwait for several hours, I hated being outside due to this hellish traffic.
The usually 20 minute trip took me an hour and 10 minutes, and a 15 minute trip took one hour in the car.
I went nuts sitting in a car going 10 kph, and knowing the traffic is being cause by the idiots who didn’t plan this out.
They should have a fleet of helicopters to transport these dignitaries instead of causing over 7 hours worth of traffic without any warning.
Macedonia: Use of New Media in Election Campaign · Global Voices
Authors of the Macedonian media blog Komunikacii.net, analyzed (MKD) the "unprecedented" use of the internet and the new media by the leading political parties in the campaign for the early parliamentary elections, scheduled for June 1, 2008.
Media experts Sead Dzigal and Darko Buldioski provided joint analysis of the web presence of both the incumbent party, VMRO-DPMNE, and the main opposition party, SDSM:
Good: use of blogs, YouTube channels, Myspace, Facebook, Hi5 etc.
Good also: use of video, audio, posting documents, comments, etc.
Most of—it seems all—the campaign materials are available online, too.
The websites receive regular updates… and heavily use free online services, apparently to cut costs, which seems like a smart move.
Bad: the "social" portion is absent in their use of social media.
The blog posts are mainly transcripts of their rally speeches, and the content is basically recycled from their TV commercials and other uses such as to be fed to traditional media, analysts, journalists and similar actors, but not blogs per se.
The posts are long, different audiences are targeted in each post, and personal experiences or input from the politicians is lacking.
Even the impressions on their events are lacking, depriving their blogs of the essential individual, personal perspective. The video clips are made for TV and not for vlogs, print campaigns which do not fit viral media, photos as décor and not as source of (inside) information.
Probably these are the reasons why these blogs do not receive many visits, there are but a few comments, and are simply left out of the general political discussion (for the time being).
In conclusion , it's great that political parties adopted many new services and channels for electoral propaganda, but the effects will probably be quite small, because the websites are used as web repositories or warehouses for loads of materials tirelessly produced for the electoral campaigns in Macedonia.
In a comment to the same post, prominent local blogger Ribaro, wrote (MKD):
The most interesting thing about the bunch of blogs created by political parties for this election is that they have some incompetent idiot appointed as administrator responding to user comments.
For instance a response to some relevant question by such person was: "And who's asking?"
Bottom!
As long as they belittle the power of the blog and the blogosphere, their blogs will receive minuscule visitor flow and only by their praising party members.
The situation was the same with the elections in 2006. They advanced in quantity, but not an inch in quality.
Iran: Blogger writes book on the impact of the Internet · Global Voices
Cyrus Farivar is a USA-based blogger, journalist and writer.
He is currently working on a book about the impact of the internet on society.
Cyrus writes about internet impact on Iran, Senegal, South Korea and Senegal.
He was recently in Iran and has taken several photos of Iranian carpets, food, buildings and nature too.
Q: You visited Iran recently after many years.
Was it a cultural shock?
Was there any difference between what you imagined, and what you came to know about Iran in reality?
A: Iran wasn't a culture shock at all.
It was pretty much what I expected, culturally.
I did grow up in a half-Iranian family in California, after all.
Iranians are terribly hospitable people and always want to be helpful and welcoming to family members like me who have never been to Iran.
Q: You are writing a book on the Internet and its impact on society.
One fourth of your book is about Iran.
Can you explain this project?
A: I am writing a book about the history and effects of the Internet in four countries around the world, including Estonia, Iran, Senegal and South Korea.
It explores how the political and economic histories of these countries intersect with the arrival of the Internet in their countries.
It is tentatively titled “The Internet of Elsewhere” and will be published by Rutgers University Press (USA) in late 2009.
Q: Why did you choose these four countries for your book?
A: I chose these countries because they each represent vastly different experiences when it comes to the Internet.
Senegal, because it's a Sub-Saharan African country, and yet, relative to many others in the region is politically and economically stable.
It should be ripe for greater Internet penetration, and yet, it's not.
Estonia, because of the rapid changes that it has gone through since its emergence from the Soviet Union in 1991.
It went from barely any communication with the outside world in 1991 to having more mobile phones than citizens today.
South Korea, because it has the largest rate of Internet penetration in the world and has the highest and cheapest bandwidth in the world.
How did this happen?
Iran, for personal reasons but also because it's interesting to watch how the Internet, a disruptive technology in and of itself, intersects with the theocracy and budding democratic thinkers of the early 21st century.
Q: Have you found any commonalities in these countries?
A: I have found common elements in so far as the Internet has had a dramatic effect on the contemporary histories of each country.
Even in a country like Senegal, the Internet is cheap enough to the point where even the poorest kids in Dakar can pool their money between three or four of them to share access on a machine in a cybercafe for an hour fairly regularly.
Each of these countries would look different without the proliferation of the Internet.
Q: Do you think blogs have any real influence in Iranian media and society?
A: I think that blogs do have an impact on Iran, but I wonder how much of an impact they can have now when so many blogs are filtered, and the bandwidth is slowed.
Sure, many Iranians know how to use proxies and other tools to get around the blocks, but the simple fact that many young Iranian thinkers and writers have had to leave since 2001, makes me wonder who are the winners and losers in this case.
The answers aren't obvious.
Q: Did you meet any bloggers in Iran?
What challenges are there for cyber activists?
A: I didn't meet any bloggers in Iran, but I did meet with Shahram Sharif of ITIran.com and Sina Tabesh of Wikipedia Persian.
I have spoken with many bloggers by phone and by IM previously, but unfortunately have not met many of them.
It's hard for cyber activists, even those who live outside Iran, to at once speak out against the government and feel safe in what they say, and how they say it.
Q: How was your personal experience surfing and using internet in Iran?
Slow, filtered...?
A: I stayed with my grandmother, who, despite living in North Tehran, did not have Internet access at her apartment.
During the two weeks I was there, I was only to use the Internet once, from a cyber café in the Hotel Aseman in Esfahan.
I was able to make a Skype call to the US with no problem.
That being said, I did access a VERY limited version of the Internet on my iPhone — oddly, the only website that I was able to access with any regularity was The New York Times.
Colombian anti-military youth group commemorates 10 years of resistance · Global Voices
Last May 17th marked the ten year anniversary of the Antimili sonoro , an event organized by the Youth Network as a way to spread the word about resistance to the mandatory military service in Colombia through music.
The date was celebrated with a concert, and the whole month of May was programmed with conferences, talks and marches commemorating the 10 years of the youth organization's Disobedience and Civil Resistance movement.
Showcasing the invitation to the events, the promotional clips and a short video from one of the ska bands playing in the concert.
The Youth Network organized their anti-military festival on the international day promoting Objection by Conscience, a means of opting out of the mandatory military service , by explaining that morally the individual believes that killing another human being, even within the military, is wrong.
There is testimony from youth who have opted out, as can be seen by this testimony written by Gustavo Monroy , recruited against his will and later ostracized by friends and family for refusing to be part of the military.
The anti-military group explains their objectives and beliefs in this article in English found in their myspace website.
First, this year's concert invite, subtitled in English:
A viral campaign on YouTube promoting the event:
Finally, from the concert, a low cell phone quality video of Ron Daymon ska band performance singing The Neighbor.

Videos: Creativity in facing the water crisis · Global Voices
Classic Water Drop Shot by Randy Son Of Robert. With two very recent natural disasters in mind: the cyclone in Myanmar and the Earthquake in Sichuan, China, the topic of getting pure and drinkable water to needy populations has come back into the conversation.
Following, several videos which propose different solutions to supply clean water or at least make it easier for people to have a healthful liquid to drink.
These solutions have the bases covered: well digging and water for maintaining health and hygiene after emergencies, a PlayPump and a Q-Drum roll-able water container to transport the liquid: from underneath the ground and from far away and A Bio-Sand filter and purification bicycle to help make this water they transport, clean and safe for drinking and use.
First, from South Sudan, a Video Journal which speaks about the challenges faced by the Water for Sudan project in order to build and maintain wells in rural areas of this impoverished area and how it doesn't really matter how hard it is to get started and running, because in the end, it is worth every effort.
Then, from Pakistan, Action Against Hunger decided to help the communities who had lost absolutely everything to slowly regain their confidence in a better future by including clean water in their plans.
The following video from Dogooder.tv:A few projects which make it easy for people to transport water from one area to the next.
First, the Q drum which is a rolling bottle that can be led by a rope.
Second, a play pump which pumps water from the underground watershet to a water tank up high while children play and prototype bicycle that purifies water as it is ridden.
In the areas of purification we can see the Bio-Sand filter in action, also from Action Against Hunger:
Another similar clay pot filtration product is being promoted by Potters for Peace, who train local artisans to make clay pots which can be used to filter water.
Complete instructions to make the pots and filters can be found here.
The following video is of Ron Rivera's presentation in Design for the other 90 percent symposium:
Iran: "The Internet is a gift to us" · Global Voices
Arsham Parsi is the founder and director of the Iranian Queer Organization based in Toronto, Canada.
He talked to us about the presence of Iranian homosexuals in cyberspace, their challenges and projects. Homosexuality is banned in Iran, and punishable by prison or death.
How do you evaluate the presence of homosexual blogs in the Iranian blogosphere?
Are there many bloggers that talk about their homosexuality?
Yes, we have many Iranian LGBTIQ bloggers, and most of them live inside Iran.
They have nicknames and write anonymously, which is safest for their security, but sometimes the government finds them through their IP addresses.
But they do exist and are very active.
How do you use the Internet, including blogs and video films, to talk about Iranian homosexuality?
The Internet is one of our most important communication tools.
Without the internet our organization could not do many things.
We don't have representatives in Iran because we fear for their safety; we don't want to make problems for them.
We monitor their weblogs, and it is one of our resources.
The Internet is a gift to us.
What about Iranian reactions to your website/blog?
Is there any dialogue there between people who are homosexual or defend homosexual rights, and people who consider homosexuality a "sin" or "an immoral act"?
There are different reactions.
We receive many hate messages, and also many messages of support.
In the Iranian queer weblogs, they have dialogues with other people, and sometimes bloggers address these issues.
But in general, people have changed their views in the last few years.
Is there any online forum where Iranian homosexuals exchange their ideas or leave comments?
We have a magazine, Cheraq.
And we have a forum for Iranian homosexuals too.
It started a few months ago.
But weblogs are more common.
How you see the situation of homosexuals in Iran?
Are they involved in cyberspace in order to express themselves?
As I said, a lot has changed.
I remember a few years ago, nobody talked about our rights, but now you can find thousands of pages online.
According to them, they cannot have physical relations freely, but they exist and they try to be active.
I think now, Iranian queer issues have become a human rights issue.
When you look at Iranian gay and lesbian blogs. Do they face different kinds of difficulties?
Of course yes, it is totally different.
They have different situations.
Lesbians are more invisible, and it is because of Iran's general lack of women's rights.
We don't have many lesbian blogs, and those that I know, are active in trying to say lesbians exist too.
We have an online magazine for lesbians, Hamjens-e man.
It is the first magazine for Iranian lesbians.
Do you have any project, comment or idea to share with us?
We exist, but we cannot speak out.
We should support each other.
It is our freedom tax.
Myanmar: Citizen videos in Cyclone Nargis' aftermath · Global Voices
On May 2nd, 2008, Cyclone Nargis struck Myanmar (Burma), generating massive damage and tens of thousands dead or missing.
The situation would be considered critical for any country. However, the military government or "junta" has restricted the entrance of aid by requiring all donations to pass through them.
The junta has also set up guidelines for journalists on how to report on the cyclone, restricting their communications, particularly on showing dead bodies or reporting about insufficient aid for victims, according to Burma News, a local online news source.
Global Voices Online has been providing extensive coverage of the disaster, aggregating information from different citizen media sources in the region on what is happening with food aid, water and the refugee situation as death tolls continue to rise.
Please don't hesitate to go over to our Special Myanmar Cyclone Coverage page and read the posts that the amazing team of volunteer authors have been writing with translations from Burmese blogs telling first hand accounts of life in Myanmar right now.
You can also follow our Myanmar feed on twitter.
There will also be a global blog action day on behalf of the Burmese victims on May 17th, when people are asked to tell others about the crisis in Myanmar, and some are already organizing fundraisers and events.
Japan: Experiences at IDAHO · Global Voices

Thailand: Facebook Blamed for Teen Pregnancies · Global Voices
Thailand has one of the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in the world.
It’s estimated that 120,000 unplanned teen pregnancies happen each year, and it seems popular social networking site Facebook is partly to blame for the unwanted pregnancies, if we are to believe the conclusion of the National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB):
The NESDB has revealed that people in the age group of 18-24 are the biggest group of facebook users, accounting for 40% of all users.
The Board said that the social media growth is partly to blame for the teen pregnancy problems as some youngsters post seducing messages or video clips online.
Image from Pattaya Daily News
Saksith Saiyasombut, on the other hand, highlights the inadequacies of Thailand’s sexual education program:
Of course the largest social network is to be blamed for the all the steamy content that drive teenagers to have unprotected sex.
Or it could be the much more simple explanation – Thailand has a severe problem with sexual education.
If the moral outrage could be put to one side, the powers that be might be able to see that the only reasonable solution to avoid teen pregnancies is to have proper sexual education and face the naked truth about the existence of sexuality instead of tucking it away.
Ricefieldradio comments that social media has nothing to do with teen pregnancies:
Facebook and other Social media has nothing to do with teen pregnancies or sex.
It's hormones.
Young people managed to have sex way before any of the social network founders mothers was even inseminated.
Tasty Thailand also points out the reduced sex education classes in Thailand:
After all, 18 may be technically a 'teen' but, by law, it's actually the age of an adult.
So that doesn't fit the 'blame Facebook' camp for teen pregnancies at all Because, after all, Thailand's growing teen pregnancy rate can't be because sex education classes in Thai schools have been drastically reduced in recent years, or because Thai parents don't teach their kids about contraception now can it?
FACT - Freedom Against Censorship Thailand recognizes the role of parenting:
Sure, Facebook may make it easier for our kids to hook up.
But it’s bad parenting which fails to supervise your kid on a computer.
Maybe kids just need to play football with friends…a lot of football!]
Here are some reactions on Twitter.
From @thaimythbuster:
#THailand #Facebook did it and shares the blame for Thailand's teen pregnancies.
Wondering who was to blame ten years ago… Prem?
@CoconutsBangkok To think, we always thought unprotected sex causes teen pregnancies.
Apparently Facebook does actually!
This is not the first time that Facebook was blamed for rising teen pregnancies.
Last year, a religious leader in Central Java, Indonesia also blamed the giant social network for the rise of underage marriages and unwanted teen pregnancies in the country.
Malawi's Ex-President Under House Arrest · Global Voices
Following recent reports of alleged coup plotters, police yesterday picked up and put Malawi's former president Bakili Muluzi under house arrest.
Lilongwe-based Journalist Bright Sonani gives eyewitness accounts as events unfolded at Kamuzu International Aiport in Lilongwe where Muluzi was picked as he arrived from a trip from the UK:
After the dramatic arrest right inside the Kamuzu International Aiport grounds at around 2.45 pm, the UDF Chairman was 30 minutes later whisked into a waiting Malawi Armed Forces Military Plane the 16 Seater Dornier which flew him straight to Blantyre.
Muluzi’s son Atupele confirmed that his father has been charged with treason.
However, government yesterday declined to immediately comment on the arrest which drew tension inside the city of Lilongwe with running battles between the police and UDF supporters who, angered, with the development closed roads especially those leading to KIA.....
“They have arrested the former President apparently on treason charges.
They don’t have a warrant, they refused him to leave the airport, they want to take him in a military aircraft to an undisclosed location,” said Atupele, who was the only top UDF politician and Muluzi’s closest ally allowed into the airport grounds, soon after the arrest.
Soon after the arrest Police also instantly moved in to disarm the former head of state’s government security personnel.
The arrest of Muluzi has followed eight senior security and opposition political figures who have since been granted bail.
Meanwhile Malawi's president Bingu wa Mutharika is in Japan for a meeting of African leaders.
There are mixed reactions to the recent arrests.
While all this is happening, one Malawian blogger is running a poll on how Malawians look at the recent arrests.
Lebanon: An Eyewitness Report · Global Voices
Lebanese journalist and blogger Lelia Mezher was one of several Lebanese bloggers who worked round the clock to keep the world informed about the crisis which rocked her country when different factions clashed in Beirut.
Global Voices Online caught up with Mezher, who is involved with News Lab, in this quick interview.
* Who is Lelia Mezher?
Occupation?
Experience?
Interests?
Fears?
Hopes?
I'm a Lebanese journalist at L'Orient Le Jour, a Lebanese daily newspaper, written in French.
Actually it's the only French daily newspaper in Lebanon.
I studied law and specialised in Internet Law and then did political science.
I studied law in Lebanon then moved to Paris for my Internet Law (Paris I - La Sorbonne ) diploma and my Political Science diploma (Paris 2 -Assas).
After numerous internships in Paris between 2003 and 2006 (legal department at the Ministry of Economy, eGovernment agency affiliated to the Prime Minister bureau and an internship at Clifford Chance Law Firm), I didn't find a job their so I applied for an internship at L'Orient Le Jour.
I started in July 2006, a few days before the Hezbollah-Israeli war.
I got the job in August 2006.
My worst nightmare right now is the lack of freedom.
With the Hezbollah imposing itself more and more, I'm afraid press freedom will dramatically drop, as well as women's freedom.
I really hope Lebanese will get to a point where they learn from their mistakes and stop repeating them every once in a while.
No religious community can win over the other - Lebanon is a country of diversity.
On a more personal level, I hope I can evolve in my career and one day be proud of my country, and stop feeling that the government is never there to look after you.
* What is Newslab about?
NewsLab was a Canal France International – Anna Lindt foundation initiative.
It’s my editor-in-chief Nagib Aoun who told me about it.
A 10-day reunion in Alexandria to create a blog.
When we met, 20 different women from 10 different countries, its was not easy to get along.
But today I can say that we succeeded and we know what the blog is for.
It allows u to remain free, especially in the Arab world.
In Lebanon, we are free to write or say whatever we want, unlike in Egypt or Syria.
So for me this blog had to be first and foremost for the Arab women.
But not all of them write.
Some completely abandoned the blog.
* What contribution have Lebanese bloggers had on voicing the concerns and fears of citizens on the ground during this current crisis?
In Lebanon, bloggers allow us to have an independent point of view of the situation since every political party has its own media here.
There's no independent TV or newspaper except maybe L’Orient le Jour.
Blogs were first considered as a threat to newspapers.
Today they complete each other and blogs have become part of the sources of information on which you can rely.
* How has the Lebanese media dealt with covering the current crisis and how different was that coverage from what citizen journalists wrote on their blogs?
Strangely enough, not all the media was biased this time while covering the events.
Journalists in many cases were indeed the voice of the people.
One same impression of disappointment and sadness was everywhere.
A big number of journalists managed to express the people’s feeling, unlike before.
Maybe it’s the fear of a new civil war who created this reaction among the journalists.
Bahrain: When sect determines your spouse · Global Voices
Coolred38 is an American Muslim living in Bahrain, and she often finds herself frustrated at examples of what she sees as bad and even harmful behaviour being justified by religion.
She recently posted about a 'scandal' in the family of a friend of hers:
Long story short...Sunni girl and Shiite boy have loved each other for 5 years...secretly.
Both were terrified to tell family members knowing exactly what the reaction would be... ...Fear gave way to a determination to either get married with everyone's blessing...or get married and go it alone...which is basically what it boiled down to.
His family are refusing to talk to him...many of her family have abandoned her.
All of this hate and anger for what...cause he is Shiite and she is Sunni...aren't they both Muslim though? … I am constantly amazed at this lifelong animosity felt between these two sects of Islam...so much anger and resentment and claims that the other is not living Islam the proper way...far as I can see...the moment each became a "sect" each was not living Islam properly.
Islam was meant to unite Muslims...to unite the community into a common understanding and belief.
To make Muslims feel safe among each other at least if not among non Muslims.
God gave us the Quran as a source of guidance to bring us together and live peacefully with each other...justice always in our thoughts and actions...and yet most Muslims spend all their lives tearing Muslims apart....but they do it with culture.
It is culturally not acceptable for Sunnis to marry Shiites and vice versa...God does not forbid Muslims from marrying each other...hell if we can marry Ahal al Kitab (people of the Book) then we can damn sure marry fellow Muslims...and yet Muslims themselves have made "laws" that forbid Muslims from marrying Muslims...the ego of man knows no limits. … The one man who the girl's family assumed would go ballistic and do something apparently violent to her (or maybe the boy) turned out to be the most level headed and genuine Muslim of the whole lot....both families included.
When her mother approached him (as her husband is dead so the uncle is the guardian) with this "devastating" news...shaking with certainty that this tragic news would cause fire to explode from his eyes and some sort of mini Jihad of death to automatically take over his thinking skills...he said something quite astounding to everyone who heard it.
He quietly commented that if his niece loved this boy...who was he to deny her choice of a husband? … I am in awe of this Muslim man that, while professing his identity as a Muslim with his tongue...also professed it with his actions.
Something few Muslims are prepared or willing to do. … I wish these two newly weds much success in life and may they have a happy and long love filled marriage that many Sunni/Sunni or Shiite/Shiite marriages do not...may God bless their marriage...even if their fellow Muslims do not.
Gardens of Sand commented on the post that she knows of many such examples:
Sad to say this animosity still goes on.
While I consider myself Muslim, my father is Shi'i and my mum is Sunni. … My best friend was beat with a shoe by her mum when she professed her love for a Shi'i. … Another Sunni friend said that a cousin was old & so desperate to marry she married a Shi'i man.
I could go on and on and on... Really what can you tell to people who perpetuate sectarianism all the while condemning it and/or professing innocence and claiming it's the others to blame??

Uzbekistan: Tashkent blogged · Global Voices
It is very interesting to notice that during the recent days the Uzbek blogosphere was mainly discussing Tashkent, the capital city of Uzbekistan.
Today, Tashkent is at a stand of its beauty, as it is too early for summer heat and it is green and clean also.
For a long time Tashkent has been the heartland of Central Asia - unlike other Stans - having closer ties with Kremlin and being the capital of the only Central Asian country that has borders with all other four countries of the region plus Afghanistan.
Today, Tashkent still plays a significant role in the region's political and economic life.
However, the blogosphere was neglecting the Tashkent's position in the region and was mainly discussing the antique historical sites and beautiful infrastructure of the city that has been under constant reconstruction after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Lilianitta writes in her blog that she had been looking for a chance to go out and see the historical Tashkent for a long time, and she has finally got this chance.
She describes historical facts of the city and posts many interesting photos of ancient mosques, medereses and tombs of Muslim clerics.
In 2009, we will celebrate Tashkent’s 2200 anniversary.
The downtown is now full of very tall modern buildings - hotels, banks, business centers.
A friend of mine says they make the city lose its individuality.
He may be right, though I personally like everything in Tashkent.
But in the Old Town everything is very special - eastern markets, communities and old narrow streets.
Everything is surprisingly original.
Another great collection of fresh photos of Tashkent one can find in Alexander’s blog.
Alexander writes a post about his travel to Tashkent from Novosibirsk, Russia.
Tashkent is very warm, green, and a pleasant city in all respects.
Uzbeks are very hospitable and positive people.
It is snowing in Novosibirsk, but in Uzbekistan it is +32 C… Right after we landed and passed all custom controls, we found ourselves in an old Soviet taxi, and went to a house of a person with whom we got acquainted in the airport… The Uzbek cuisine, I must say, is not only specific, but also very delicious.
Alexander continues writing counting the advantages of the city and attaching the photo to it as a proof.
Tashkent is very clean.
You don't see garbage, especially in the center.
The air is so fresh and there is no dust… Uzbek girls are very beautiful… It may be very surprising, but there is almost no traffic jams in the city… Many historical sites, especially old mosques… The prices are surprisingly low.
Another interesting post about Tashkent one can find in Narishka’s blog, where she writes about her memories of Tashkent.
According to her, Tashkent is one the greatest places she has ever been to and that one must travel there in order to understand her.
Narishka makes a list of her memories writing every detail of life in Tashkent:
1.
In Tashkent, you never pay more than 2 cents for a bundle of fennel.
6.
You are at least once in a while are waken up early in the morning by the crazy sounds of national musical instruments from the wedding ceremony in your neighborhood.
15.
You know that Broadway exists not only in the States.
32.
Tea is served in pialas , and you know that it is not polite to serve a full piala, just on the bottom.
There is also a thematic blog dedicated to Tashkent, hosting fresh photos, interesting facts and news about Tashkent.
One of the peculiarities of this blog is that it gives many links to other sources, where you can find lots of useful information about the city.

Kuwait: Protest Against the Prime Minister · Global Voices
Kuwaiti Prime Minister Sheikh Nasser Al-Mohammed Al-Sabah had not had a break from attacks from the parliament and continuous sit-ins since February 2006.
Beginning on March 8, and thanks to the Arab Spring, Kuwaitis have continued to protest to demand the removal of the prime minister, who had just formed his seventh cabinet.
On Friday, May 27, Kuwaiti opposition held another protest for the same purpose, calling it The Friday of Anger.
A lot of confusion was going on over the past days; the protesters insisted on going to Safat Square while the Interior Minister warned them not to go there, which led the opposition to have two different opinions; one was insisting on going to Safat Square to make a clear statement and another asking to change the place to Irada Square to avoid clashing with security forces. Picture of protesters near the parliament as posted by The Voice of Kuwait blog
The protest, at the end, happened and moved from one square to the other, ending in Safat Square without any clashes reported with security forces, who did not want a confrontation.
Protesters burned the pictures of the parliament members who support the prime minister, while the Interior Ministry stopped Mubashar TV Channel from broadcasting the protest live.
Kuwaiti tweep Abdullah Al-Shatti complimented the youth on their protest saying: @abdullahahmad81: Between Irada Square and Safat Square, the youth gathered with a strong will and pure soul aiming for a better change.
Some wonder, until when should the Fridays of Anger continue?
Another Kuwaiti tweep, Naser AlMutairi, asked a question addressed to the prime minister saying: @q87ar: Is Nasser Al-Mohammed waiting for all the Kuwaiti people to protest and sit in Safat or Irada square to resign for the sake of Kuwait?
On the other hand, Kuwaiti tweep with the nickname Aladly has criticized the youth who participated in the protest saying: @aladly: Civilised youth, who want to draw the political future of the country, lack the simplest dialogue language and got lost between Irada and Safat square.
Another tweep called Aqeel Al-Qallaf criticized Salafi parliament member Walid Al-Tabtabi who participated in the Angry Friday saying:
! @aqeelov: Walid Al-Tabtabi who insisted on protesting in Safat square, has objected to this behavior in 2006 in a question addressed to the government!
Lawyer Mohammed Fahad Al-Ajmi wrote a tweet demanding the departure of the prime minister: @DrAlajmi: There are many squares in my country; Safat, Irada, Tahrir, Horiya, Al-Alam, Taghier, Majles.. seven squares and seven cabinets.. there are many squares but there is one goal..
Leave. Young tweep Abdulrahman Alshaibani wrote his comment on the Friday of Anger saying: @A_Alshaibani: Safat square: is the youth square - the peaceful protesting square - the freedom of expression square - the constitution square - and the martyrs' square.
Kuwaiti blogger, Hamad, wrote a post evaluating the Interior Minister's position towards the protesters.
Many have complimented the minister's decision not to clash with protesters despite entering Safat square.
Hamad, though, says this cannot really tell us the truth about the minister's position: What happened in Safat square is not a serious matter, therefore, we cannot read the Interior Minister's position towards the protests.
Kuwaiti blogger Mohammed Alhujailan wrote a post defending the protesting youth from those who described them as unpatriotic: Those who are attacking the protesters should have supported them with a word or a stance instead.
If you cannot, and you will not, then you should remain silent and let the youth save the country that you could not save because they are better than you.
Another blogger, 3ajel, wrote a post regarding the issue of where the protests should take place:
ساحة الصفاة مصيدة، وساحة الإرادة حجة عليهم لا عليكم، وطالما أن الهدف هو التعبير عن غضبكم فالمكان أي مكان يكفي Safat square is a trap, Irada square is an advantage for you not against you, and as long you aim to express your anger, then the place does not matter.
Bahrain: Detainees at home and abroad · Global Voices
Last December, a number of Bahrainis were arrested following clashes between protestors and security forces, and many are still being detained.
Allegations have been made that some of them are being tortured.
In February, eight Bahrainis were arrested in Saudi Arabia, apparently for straying into a restricted area.
Concern has been expressed about the health of one of the December detainees, Abdulla Mohsen, who used to be a blogger, and Babbling Bahrania has addressed an open letter to him:
Dearest Abdullah,
The “cage went in search of a bird” - Kafka.
It was only a matter of time – but still, I didn’t expect you to be caged up for this long.
Each word is a dagger wrenched out of a heart weighed heavy with shame, guilt and sorrow over what you are having to endure.

Meanwhile, Ahmed Al Bader writes about the eight men being detained in Saudi Arabia: هم ثمانية محتجزين بالمملكة العربية السعودية (مجيد عبدالرسول سلمان الغسرة، عباس أحمد إبراهيم، سيدأحمد علوي عبدالله، عيسى عبدالحسن أحمد، محمد حسن علي مرهون، محمد عبدالله المؤمن، إبراهيم مرزم ومحمد مهدي) قصتهم أغرب إلى الخيال تم احتجازهم في بداية شهر مارس الفائت لا بسبب جرم أو إرهاب وإنما لأنهم أضاعوا الطريق ليدخلوا بالخطأ منطقة عسكرية محظورة، والعجيب بالأمر أنهم منذ احتجازهم حتى يومنا هذا وهم بالسجون الانفرادية لا يعلمون عن بعضهم بعض وفي أول وأخر زيارة لهم تمت قبل ثلاثة أسابيع قال أهاليهم الذي التقوا بهم بأنه أشكالهم تغيرت بصورة كبيرة وأثار التعب على وجوهم نعم التعب الجسدي والنفسي، تعب الابتعاد عن الأهل والوطن.
Every person on this Earth has a nation; every nation has a people; all people have governments and all governments have laws and constitutions.
However, there are eight people being held without a nation or a government which cares for them.
They are eight people with university degrees, who are the educators of generations in a nation with citizens, a government and a constitution.
Is is possible that a government ignores its citizens who are being held in the prisons of a neighbour, which maintains a close brotherly relation with, and not just a causeway.
What ties us to them is the strength of love, cooperation and inter-marriages.
They are eight held in Saudi Arabia (Majeed Abdulrasool Salman Al Ghasra, Abbas Ahmed Ibrahim, Sayed Ahmed Alawi Abdulla, Isa Abdulhassan Ahmed, Mohammed Hassan Ali Marhoon, Mohammed Abdulla Al Moamen, Ibrahim Marzam and Mohammed Mahdi).
Their story is stranger than fiction.
They were arrested at the beginning of March not for a crime they committed but because they took a wrong turn and entered a restricted military zone.
What is strange in the matter is that they have been in solitary confinement, each in a cell not knowing of the other, since their arrest.
In the first and only visit of their families to them, three weeks ago, their families said that their attires have changed a lot since they last saw them and that the effects of physical and mental exhaustion was apparent on their faces - the exhaustion of being away from home and relatives.
They all enjoy a clean record - morally and politically.
They have nothing to do with politics.
Their interests are in sports or cultural activities.
Where is justice, humanity and rights?
They have not committed a crime or have been sentenced by a court of law.
Since their arrest to this day, the same comment is being repeated: "Nothing has been proved against them and investigations are continuing."
This is the third month and investigations are still continuing.
Will those eight ever find the nation which nurtured and protected them?
France: Demonstration in Paris Against Gabon Dictatorship · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage of Gabon Unrest 2011.
The small West African country of Gabon has been experiencing weeks of political tension, as two governments - official and unofficial - have both lain claim to the presidency.
On Sunday 27 February, 2011, self-proclaimed unofficial president André Mba Obame left the United Nations Development Programme building in capital Libreville, where he had been taking refuge.
The day before, 7,000 people gathered in the streets of French capital Paris to demonstrate against African dictators and the French government's alleged collusion with African dictatorial regimes.
Protesters left from Place de la République and headed to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, via 51 rue de l'Université, where Ali Bongo Ondimba (current official Gabonese president) owns a 140 million Euro mansion.
Both Gabonese and Libyan activists were present in the procession.

Macedonia: Graffiti Art in "Times of Revived Antiquity" · Global Voices
A short documentary on the Macedonian graffiti scene in the context of the state-sponsored art/construction boom, made by two female scientists and bloggers-Vasilka Dimitrovska and Ilina Jakimovska-has been shown at the renowned archeological conference Buffalo TAG 2012.
Entitled "Lions, Warriors and Graffiti Artists: Counter-Culture in Times of Revived Antiquity", the documentary juxtaposes (an important visual arts theory word!) information about the vigorous efforts of the government to impose new, polished classicist/baroque visual identity on the center of the Macedonian capital through the Skopje 2014 project (which features bronze lions), with interviews of people from the graffiti scene.
A co-author, archeologist Dimitrovska, wrote this on her blog, injecting a disclaimer often heard by people who dare to speak in public in Macedonia:
We made this documentary... in order to document with love part of the graffiti which disappeared or are about to disappear due to the new urban concepts implemented in our country, primarily in Skopje.
The project has no political dimension, nor did we intend it to have any political connotation.
This small project on Macedonian graffiti was made with modest finances, and we intended to present-without any censorship or montage of statements-the voices and opinions of the graffiti artists who shaped or are still shaping the visual part of this subculture, which is punishable by the laws but is also used (not abused) by the political class in power.
In the film, the interviewed artists also feel the need to decline any interest in political life.
They talk about being torn between the threat of punishment if caught "writing" on their own (EUR 50 at least), and becoming a sell-out for commercial reasons or in local government projects, which sometimes involve co-opting graffiti artists to legally adorn specified public buildings.
They also mention a quickly forming generation gap within the subculture.
It might sound incredible, but the graffiti are - folklore!
Regardless of whether they convey messages through drawing or text, the graffiti, for those who make them and those who read them on city walls, are a form of expression and communication.
If you have something hidden deep inside you, something that aches and burns you, write it on the wall, and it will speak it...
Some of my favorites from Skopje include "A woman is not a woman unless she's a woman," "Thank God I'm an atheist"...
In the past, other bloggers such as Alexx or Django wrote about Skopje graffiti.
The artists featured in the documentary do not have online presence on the public internet, but sometimes publish photos of their work within Facebook.
Spain: From Spanish Revolution to World Revolution · Global Voices
Demonstrations on the streets of Madrid on May 15 have turned into big camp outs all over Spain, and across the world.
There had not been any police intervention since the second day of protests in Madrid, May 17, but on the morning of May 27 Barcelona protesters started sending messages that they were being evicted.
According to the police, it was not an eviction but an attempt to allow for the cleaning patrols to do their job.
Videos showing police charging against demonstrators have gone viral:
Updates can be followed through @acampadabcn twitter user and through the #acampadabcn hashtag:

The extent of the movement has exceeded everyone's expectations.
Protests in Spain have turned into something quite different from what the first demonstrations were.
The group Democracia Real Ya (Real Democracy Now), which organized the May 15 march, has since dissociated from the camps organization, whose updates can now be followed through the Tomalaplaza.net (Take the Square) website. Spanish independent news site Periodismo Humano published on May 26 a report on the first 40 people who decided to camp out on May 16, which lead to a movement that gathered tens of thousands and has become global.

Poland: The 'Web Kids' Manifesto' · Global Voices
Originally written by the Polish photographer and poet Piotr Czerski (see Wikipedia for his biography in Polish), the 'Web Kids’ Manifesto' is now appearing on the web in many other languages since its publication on February 11, 2012, in the Polish regional newspaper, Dziennik Baltycki.
The manifesto expresses the sense of community of a whole generation born alongside the arrival of the networks and Internet.
It also proclaims the affinity of young people around the world with the emergence of an original global culture and the desire to participate in the circulation of cultural goods, beyond the legal or geographical frontiers arbitrarily imposed.
According to Czerski, the manifesto is evidence of this generation’s desire to distance itself from the power relations inherited from the established authorities :

A rekindled interest in the richness of the Amazon is one of the results of recently distributed photograph showing members of an uncontacted tribe in the Brazilian Amazon shooting arrows at the photographer's airplane which surfaced on the Internet on May 23rd.
However, to some organizations, the Amazon has never been far from their minds, and today we´ll see some videos brought by Amazon Watch, some which were showcased on Witness' The Hub editorial section.
First, a video explaining the extent of damages that are imputed to the Chevron- Texaco oil company toxic waste management which for years has contaminated the Amazonian Basin in Ecuador.
In the following video, indigenous group members tell about their health problems, cancer and their case against Chevron-Texaco where they ask them to clean up after themselves.
Then, from The Hub, curator Chris Michael picked the following two videos.
First, an animation which spoofs corporate propaganda videos and shows a different perspective on the toxic oil waste disaster in Ecuador, inviting viewers to learn more about the trial, about Chevron-Texaco in Ecuador and answers to their replies that they were within the law and weren't the cause of the disaster, and in general about the harm of oil exploitation in the amazonian basin at Chevrontoxico.com The next video portrays the story of how the tribal leaders are still struggling to keep this disaster from repeating itself, and the Ecuadorian government's insistence on leasing tracts of land where Indigenous reserves lie for oil exploitation, not just without the indigenous tribe's approval but in spite of their open opposition.

Egypt: Mubarak Fined for Internet Blackout during Revolution · Global Voices
An Egyptian court has fined ousted Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak and other officials 540 million Egyptian pounds ($90m) for disconnecting the Internet and mobile phone services during the revolution which toppled him, it was announced today.
According to Reuters, the administrative court fined Mubarak 200 million pounds, former Prime Minister Ahmed Nazif 40 million pounds, and former interior minister Habib al-Adly 300 million pounds for their damage to the national economy.

Mubarak's regime first shut down access to Twitter when protests first started on January 25, then Facebook on January 26, before turning off the Internet on January 28.
Here are some citizen media reactions on the story.
On Twitter, UAE columnist Sultan Al Qassemi reports:
Al Jazeera: Egypt: Mubarak fined $90 million for disconnecting the Internet & mobile phone services during the revolution. #Jan25
The fine left some Egyptian tweeps scratching their heads, making some reach out to their calculators to see if the spoils will get filtered down to subscribers.
Mohammed Hamdy asks: How much do we get from this $90m?
This means that the companies should compensate us for damages or do they just take the money?
Mohammed Yousif, who tweets @JawazSafar, adds:
Sentencing on Mubarak seems based on financial impact. he also should be trialled for easing-murdering & forbidding SOS services #Egypt
And Egyptian lawyer and the executive director of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information Gamal Eid adds: Our case is against the telecommunication companies.
We are accusing them as accomplices in the killing of Egyptian protesters until they prove their innocence with documentation
Mexico: Teacher Sings with Students During Shooting · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Mexico's Drug War. The YouTube video showing a kindergarten teacher singing with her students to keep them calm during a shooting in Monterrey, Mexico has spread almost virally through the Spanish speaking countries.
The video recorded by the teacher on a cellphone shows a classroom full of very young children lying on the floor.
The teacher is heard gently asking her students to keep their heads on the floor while shots are heard in the background.
She reassures the children that everything is ok, and that they'll be safe in the classroom, reminding them to keep their heads down.
To distract them, she starts singing with them.
She selects the Raindrop Song from the Barney show: in Spanish, it wonders about what would happen if raindrops were made out of chocolate and how you'd open the mouth wide to catch them all.
By getting the children to sing the song she managed not only to keep them calm but also to have them stay with their heads on the floor, as she prompted them to turn over and look up to the sky with their mouths opened wide.
Local media has identified the school as being located in the Colonia Nueva Estanzuela, just meters away from where an armed group on seven vans arrived to murder five people at an independent taxi base, and the teacher, whose identity is yet unknown has been called a hero and has been recognized by media and viewers for showing courage, character and love to her wards.

The Balkans: Over Half of the Population Uses the Internet · Global Voices
There are over 10.5 million Internet users in the Balkans/the former Yugoslavia, which makes up 51.7 percent of the region's population, according to a recent report .
The findings cited by Huge Media, in collaboration with Marko Tomić, a student from the Faculty of Organizational Sciences, University of Belgrade, show that Slovenia has the highest Internet service penetration (63.29 percent), while Bosnia and Herzegovina has the lowest (51.76 percent of Internet users).
It is interesting that over a half of the Serbian and Croatian population is on the Internet, and the authors of these findings consider that there's an incomplete research evaluation of Internet usage by the Statistical Office of the Republic of Serbia (RZS):
...As for the Internet users, we think that the RZS assessment is incomplete and does not include users of mobile internet. only examining a particular set of data that gives us information about a particular topic, but not the complete story that interests us.
Facebook is the most popular destination: over 70 percent of Internet users have a Facebook account in Serbia, and 63 percent - in Croatia:
The average time spent on Facebok is 25 minutes (both for Serbia and Croatia), and the average user in Serbia checks his/her Facebook account 16 times a day, while in Croatia it is 13 times a day.
The increasing number of Facebook users can be explained by non-residents of Serbia and Croatia using this social network during their travels.
The online social dynamics and the activities on Facebook do not differ much in other Balkan countries.
Last year, we published the data on the Serbian young adults who spend the most of their time on Facebook, communicating with their friends (61 percent), “like”-ing their statuses (66 percent), sharing content and information (56 percent), writing private messages (47 percent), and playing games (22.4 percent).
Statistical and educational institutions in each of the Balkan countries could generate and use the data on the relevant online activities to detect and focus on their critical users, to adjust their policies and action plans based on the data.
It would be also interesting to see age distribution among users and other relevant demographics, as well as the analysis of online social interactions on other Internet services and social media sites.
Currently, research is being conducted on the social media usage among young adults, students, educators, and scholars in Serbia, but it is limited, in a way, as it cannot be considered a sample for the entire Balkan population.
Each country could work on their local national data for cross-statistical area analyses for the future.
Croatia: EU Membership Approval · Global Voices
On June 10, 2011, Croatia was cleared to become the newest member state of the European Union.
There is still a long road before Croatians are officially a part of the EU, and the timing at the moment is, at best, precarious, creating many skeptics.
Beyond the current state of the economy in Europe, there is also the fact that on April 15, 2011, the ICTY convicted former generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač of war crimes.
As noted on This Just In:
The verdict was greeted by boos and hisses from crowds gathered in the central square of Croatia's capital, Zagreb, the BBC reported.
The generals are regarded by some as national heroes.

This public opinion is important to note, as prior to joining, Croatia will hold a national referendum which, if held currently, could fail with approximately only 38 percent voting "yes" or could pass easily with 64 percent voting in favor of joining, depending on the source.
Despite this electorate uncertainty, the Croatian government has continually pushed forward on the joining, as noted on Jutarnji List:
said that the decision of the European Council is a joyful moment for Croatia, especially as Croatia this week marks the 20th anniversary of independence.
"I have always said that this would be the greatest reward for the anniversary of independence," stressed the Prime Minister.
Of course, most of the accession frustration in this country of 4.5 million people revolves around the length of time it has taken to get to this point, as was written on gospon profesor:
So, these six so far and two more?
And I thought that when we finish negotiations, hop, here we are in the EU.
But, no.
A commenter on that post by the name of Kinky Kolumnista approaches the pending accession from a practical standpoint:
Let's face it, if there was no pressure from the EU, none of these minor improvements would have happened and we were the same quagmire as before EU countries are definitely more successful than we are, and those who are bypassed are at a disadvantage.
Much will still be expected of Croatia in the next two years, but currently everything points to their becoming the 28th member of the EU.

Technology for Transparency: Final Report · Global Voices
The Technology for Transparency Network is proud to announce the release of its final report, Global mapping of technology for transparency and accountability.
The report is being published by the Transparency and Accountability Initiative (@TAInitiative) along with a over a dozen other reports on the global transparency movement.
The reports focus on three key research areas: Impact and Learning, New Technologies, and Policy Innovations.
Many thanks go to the Transparency and Accountability Initiative for supporting our work, to our amazing team of researchers, and to David Sasaki, who launched and directed the initial phase of the Technology for Transparency Network, which laid the groundwork for this report.
Get the report
Full report via the Transparency and Accountability Initiative Executive summary: English
Executive Summary
This report contains the key findings from having reviewed more than 100 projects and having interviewed dozens of practitioners in Central and Eastern Europe, East Asia, Latin America, the Middle East and North Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, the former Soviet Union, and Sub-Saharan Africa who use new technologies as a means to increase transparency and accountability.
This summary helps to ‘take the pulse‘ of the Technology for Transparency and Accountability movement and suggests both exciting possibilities for scaling impact as well as important caveats and challenges.
For practitioners in the transparency and accountability space, it is useful to frame the potential for leveraging technology towards transparency and accountability initiatives in at least four ways: Bringing projects and interventions to scale.
Bringing citizens closer to the policymaking process through new and improved channels of participation as well as citizen monitoring of government.
Identifying policy priorities and service delivery challenges through ‘data mashing‘ and other visualisation and data manipulation techniques of both government and private datasets.
Improving the efficiency of civil society organisations working in the transparency and accountability space through adoption of best practice technology platforms.
Additional Findings
The majority of projects we studied focus on the executive or legislative branches of government.
A smaller number of projects focus on the judicial branch, the media, the private sector, and donors.
Nearly half of the projects focus on monitoring elections.
While many of these use Ushahidi, some have developed their own approaches, including aggregating elections news from multiple sources on a single site and tracking official election monitors’ reports on Google Maps.
Projects in multiple regions focus on transparency in the legislature, often tracking legislative bills and posting profiles for each representative that include biographies and voting records.
Some also include profiles of political parties or records of legislative spending.
Data visualization and navigation tools are a key feature in more than half of the projects we documented, as are diverse forms of data collection from citizens.
Approximately one third of the projects use mobile phones in some way, most commonly by allowing citizens to submit or receive information via text messages.
What's next?
The Technology for Transparency Network website will remain open as a place where we can share projects, tools, and ideas, as a meeting point for successful initiatives and those who want to learn from the work others have done.
You can subscribe to our mailing list, read or contribute with specialized articles on Global Voices Online, and follow us on Twitter (@techtransparent) and Facebook.
This field is just beginning to emerge, and we look forward to helping nurture global efforts through collaboration and communication across borders.
Iran: "Islamic Awakening" or NATO Victory in Libya? · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Uprising 2011.
Iranian citizens continue to follow recent developments in Libya with great interest, and are flooding cyberspace with comments, posts and tweets.
While some Iranian officials and diplomats are calling Libya's revolution, "an Islamic awakening," Iranian blogger Bedone Onvan has published a photo of an anti-Qaddafi rebel kissing a US flag, with the ironic caption: "Islamic awakening!"
Andishe writes :
It is still not clear that NATO's assistance in toppling Qaddafi's regime will be good for the Libyan population or not.
But it is obvious, that without NATO's help it would have been impossible to get rid of the Libyan dictator.
In my opinion, dictators who kill their own people and do no problem committing any crime imaginable, will not move out of scene unless a stronger hand intervenes.

Bamdadi asks his readers a question: "Which country has the highest score on the human development index in Africa?"
A link answers the question: it's Libya!
The blogger adds, "Of course, this was before civil war broke out in the country."
In another post, Bamdadi says :
I do not understand why the success of NATO and Western countries of bringing into power a new political group in Libya should make some Iranians happy? ...
Maybe they think a would be a step toward freedom'?
They are surely joking.
The countries who bombed Libya did not believe that.
What freedom?
You would be very naive to believe it... freedom should have at least a little more meaning than the militaries of the most powerful countries intervening and destroying a weak country by using tricks.
Secular writes :
The difference between Iranians and Libyans is that the latter supported defected political personalities who broke with Qaddafi's regime, while some Iranians did not want to support Mir Hussein Mousavi although he was out of regime's power structure for about 20 years.
Iranians usually say they are all the same.

This post is part of our special coverage Tunisia Revolution 2011.
Tunisian netizens have expressed their anger at a ban on protesting on Habib Bourguiba Avenue in Tunis, the capital's main street and the Tunisian equivalent of Cairo's Tahrir Square.
On March 28, 2012, the Tunisian Ministry of Interior banned any kind of protest, claiming complaints had been received from commercial and touristic businesses located on the avenue.
Recently skirmishes between Islamists and liberals occurred when two protests took place at the same time on the same street.

Iran: Smile, the Regime is Reading Your Emails · Global Voices
A growing number of Iranian bloggers expressed their anxieties after learning that their Gmail inboxes may have been an open book for the Iranian state to read and target dissidents for the last two months.
RedOrbit says:
The rogue SSL certificate is used to digitally “sign” HTTPS connections to any Google site and was issued by a Dutch company called DigiNotar on July 10.
In particular, political dissidents who put their trust in Google’s systems for their security may have been targeted in the attack.
Google reacted on August 29, 2011, saying:
Today we received reports of attempted SSL man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks against Google users, whereby someone tried to get between them and encrypted Google services...
Google Chrome users were protected from this attack because Chrome was able to detect the fraudulent certificate.
Human rights organisation, Arseh Sevom warns that Tor, Yahoo and Mozilla are targets too.
Here is Ali Borhani's (an Iran-based IT student) conversation with Google:
Hi,
Today, when I trid to login to my Gmail account I saw a certificate warning in Chrome .
I took a screenshot and I saved certificate to a file.
this is the certificate file with screenshot in a zip file:

and this is text of decoded fake certificate:
http://pastebin.com/ff7Yg663
when I used a vpn I didn't see any warning !
I think my ISP or my government did this attack (because I live in Iran and you may hear something about the story of Comodo hacker!)
Iran Online Security writes that internet users got the warning when they wanted to access their Google Docs.
While several bloggers offered advice for secure internet use such as using proxies to login to their emails, Nima Rashedan, a cyber security expert, published a video explaining to Iranian users what happened.
Nima Rashedan told me via email that most Iranian media ignored the importance of this attack.
Hackers got their hands on passwords, files, archives and unfortunately it is not limited to Google, since Yahoo, Firefox were targeted too.
Diginotar still keeps silent although it was hacked by a group that called itself "Iranian hackers".
Rashedan says the damage is beyond imagination and nothing to compare with Comodo hacking.
A new campaign was launched to protect Iranian users where we read:
Our campaign is aimed at raising awareness for the dangerous situation for Iranian netizens, especially since the Diginotar scandal.

Macedonia: No Jail Time for Participants in Inter-Ethnic Violence · Global Voices
Participants in the violent inter-ethnic incident in February 2011, on Skopje Fortress (Kale), who were identified and subject to an investigation, have received a suspended sentence in a secret trial.
Hundreds of young and not-so-young men took part in the massive brawl, preceded by a night demolition raid led by ethnic Albanian government officials against a church-shaped construction built by the government body under the management of their ethnic Macedonian coalition partners.
Skopje Fortress Kale, photo by Yemc, via Wikipedia (Public Domain)
On August 22, the authorities announced that a trial would start soon, as the Public Prosecutor's Office submitted to the Court the accusations against 51 persons for participation in rioting and obstruction of the work of the police, after a four-month investigation.
This was done through a statement relayed by a number of media outlets, including PlusInfo .
According to Utrinski Vesnik , this information was confirmed the day after by the Basic Court Skopje 1 Spokesman, Judge Vladimir Tufegdzic.
Even though a number of high-ranking government officials of the ruling DUI and VMRO-DPMNE directly and indirectly took part in the incident and the related events, including ministers, deputy ministers, mayors and other executives, the only political figure among the suspects noted by the media was Artan Grubi (more info at the end of this Global Voices post), who in the meantime participated in the June parliamentary elections as a candidate on the ticket of DUI.
On August 24, the court used the media to announce that it had already passed a sentence on August 17, the day the Prosecutor submitted the evidence and announced that the trial would start soon.
The court decided not to hold a public trial and passed a suspended sentence of three months in jail for all adult suspects.
A separate trial will be held for the six suspected minors.
The practical meaning of the sentence is that no one will have to go to jail, unless they are convicted of another felony in the next two years.
The law allows the possibility of appealing the decision not to hold a public hearing through a complaint filed within a deadline of six days by some of the involved parties.
The decision was made public after seven days, alsongside the information that no complaint had been filled by that time.
Even though this kind of a solution is allegedly allowed by the law, the fact is that the lack of a public hearing has robbed the Macedonian public of a proper closure and the official assessment did not cause an outcry.
The 'perfect timing' during the holiday season and the complacency of most commercial media ensured that critiques of this obvious example of consensual political party influence on the judiciary, such as the one by Utrinski Vesnik journalist Gordana Duvnjak, remained lonely and obscure.
She noted that the incident also resulted in bodily harm to four innocent passersby and two policemen, who did not have opportunity to partake in the decision-making process.
Blogger Neutralec (The Neutral Guy) was a rare voice who addressed this development, reminding of the aspect of hate speech spreading via social networks, which was a big deal in the media spin at the time, instigated by actors who had to prove their 'patriotism' to their prospective voters in the upcoming elections:
I personally find this decision scandalous, because there was no attempt to find the organizer signed as Goce Solunski or the chief propagandist for the march on Kale, Sasha Petkovski - Karlos.
(He was the organizer of the protests against the Greek army nationalist slogans , which took place in Skopje 15 days after that incident, after he "waited" to receive all necessary permits by the police.
Citizens of Albania who protested the day after that news became public did not wait for permits of their police or a grand leader like that to organize them.
Maybe that's why Albania is ahead of us.)
I still think that the Kale incident was perpetrated by the two ruling parties in order "to measure who has a bigger" rating, since their love at that time was "on glass feet"...
The fortress remains closed to the public.
A recent announcement by the authorities, coinciding with outing of the news about the non-trial, speaks of re-building more new buildings within its premises alongside the controversial church-like museum : an Ottoman-style tower and a prehistoric house, which will reflect the multicultural heritage.
Egypt: Using Twitter to Help a Cairo Community · Global Voices
After seeing the huge impact of social media on the Egyptian revolution, Egyptian blogger and Twitter user, Mahmoud Salem (@SandMonkey) decided to collaborate with a local non-profit organisation to help them raise funds using the power of Twitter to offer basic services in an impoverished neighborhood of Cairo.
Ezbet Khairalla is one of the largest unplanned communities in Egypt, with a population close to 650,000 inhabitants.
It is a sprawling area of about 12 square kilometres on a rocky plateau that lies in the southern part of Cairo.
Although Ezbet Khairalla is located within the boundaries of Cairo, most basic services are missing; not only sewage and garbage collection, but also inadequate education, poor health and social services.
Hence the densely populated area is considered fertile soil for crime and social unrest.

To help improve the quality of life in Ezbet Khairalla, Khair Wa Baraka (Peace and Plenty), an organisation founded in 2004, started working on educational, health and environmental programs, especially after their research showed that the most important issue in the community was dealing with both solid and liquid waster (sewage).
They also provide medical caravans and pilot educational centres.
With the support of people on Twitter, Peace and Plenty and raised EGP 2 million Egyptian pounds (over $330,000 US dollars as well as awareness for the community.
Salem called his initiative "tweetback" (@tweetbackevent), and it relied on the social capital of 20 of power-Twitter users who collectively have around a quarter of a million followers.
They each raised money from donors in exchange for giving contributing companies PR among their followers.
They also created a buzz about the initiative and helped explain to people how they can help.

Peace and Plenty held a fundraising event on July 26, 2011 at the Marriott hotel in Cairo, where they announced that EGP 1,349,000 ($226,600) had already been raised.
The twitter users who were attending also tweeted about each of the donors and how much they donated, whether it was a beverage company, a mobile operator, or even donors who refused to reveal their identities.
They also created a short-number for people to call to donate EGP 3 ($0.50), and again Twitter was used to spread the info.
The Tweetback organizers believe that this is only an initial step, and as Salem wrote in his blog, "More of these initiatives will only happen if you show support for this very first one, which by virtue of the timing, and novelty, is in desperate need for your sponsorship."
Peace and Plenty called Ezbet Khairalla, a prototype of an "unplanned community" in need of development.
Perhaps we will soon see more initiatives to help develop other unplanned communities too.
Morocco: The Twitter Opposition Party · Global Voices
On Monday 5 September, 2011, the Moroccan government launched a campaign to showcase its "achievements" since attaining power.
Posters and randomly sent SMS text messages praise the "gains harvested" after four years under the conservative government of M. Abbas El Fassi.
Makassib.ma (Makassib meaning Achievements), is a website dedicated to the campaign which comes only two months before parliamentary elections expected to be held on November 25, 2011.
Moroccan Twitter users used the platform to mock their government's claims.
Blogger Feryate writes : "The Moroccan Twittersphere has become the first opposition party against this government."
Twitter users launched a blistering assault on the government-led campaign aimed at showcasing its so-called achievements.
With a touch of humor and loads of sarcasm, Moroccan tweeters decided to dedicate a hashtag, #Makassib, to parody the alleged successes of their government.
Here is a small sample of what they have been tweeting:
Omar El Hyani (@O_El_Hyani):

Libya: Sorry Chris, Benghazi Couldn't Protect You · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Libya Revolution 2011.
A small crowd of Libyans gathered in Al Shajara Square in Benghazi today to protest against the attack on the US Consulate.
Four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens were killed when militants fired rockets at them as they were being driven to a safer location after protesters surrounded the consulate building.
News reports say protesters surrounded the Consulate, outraged over a film which ridiculed Prophet Mohammed, produced by an American-Israeli film maker.
In Cairo, a similar protest was staged, where protesters scaled the US Embassy walls, tearing down the US flag, and replacing it with an Islamic banner.
The killing of Mr Stevens and three other US Consulate staff has outraged netizens from across the region.
From Benghazi, Ahmed Sanalla shares some of the protest signs carried by the protesters on Twitter.
He tweets:
@ASanalla: Small crowd gathered in Alshajra square in #Benghazi to protest against attack on US embassy & calling 4 activation of Army & Police #Libya
Among the chants were : @ASanalla: This is the revolution of the youth - not Al Qaeda or the terrorists.
This is one of the chants at Al Shajara Square
Here is a selection of the photographs Sanalla posts from the protest.

Macedonia: Human Rights Activist Trajanoski on Trial · Global Voices
Today, at 13:00 CET, the Basic Court Skopje 1 will hold the main session of the trial against human rights activist Zarko Trajanoski, charged with defamation of Milenko Nedelkovski, a pro-government talk show host.
Trajanoski is on trial for using the term "media charlatan" in a statement on the evening news of the 'deceased' A1 TV in a discussion about Nedelkovski's ongoing hate speech campaign, including his calls to murder 'traitorous' journalists .
The latest highlight by Nedelkovski, a "journalist who acts as a personal friend to the Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski" and proudly declared with impunity that "traitors deserve hate speech," was using the tragic death of his activist son to publicly insult former A1 editor Aco Kabranov.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter Account Hacked · Global Voices
Dmitry Medvedev's Twitter snafu.
Images mixed by Kevin Rothrock.
Earlier today, hackers briefly took control of the Russian prime minister's Twitter account.
The group Anonymous International (which RuNet Echo profiled in June) later claimed responsibility.
As president and especially as prime minister, Dmitry Medvedev has been the butt of many jokes in Russia, where political observers have predicted his resignation since he took office.
Medvedev has a reputation for clumsy, sometimes even foolish public appearances.
Presumably chosen as Vladimir Putin's second-in-command because he is so unimposing, Medvedev occupied the Kremlin from 2008 to 2012, when his interest in blogs and social media helped, rather than hindered, the development of the Russian Internet.
Since Putin's return to the presidency and Medvedev's demotion to the prime minister's office, faith in Medvedev has dwindled to the frail hope that he's secretly opposed to Putin's "turning of the screws."
When Anonymous International hijacked Medvedev's Twitter account, it lampooned precisely this pipe dream.
RuNet Echo has translated some of the most amusing hacked Medvedev tweets, which were deleted the moment Twitter recaptured the account from Anonymous International.
I am resigning.
I'm ashamed of this government's actions.
Forgive me.
Other hacked tweets satirized the Russian government's expected decision to abolish individual savings accounts in the country's pension program.
One high-ranking official, Sergei Belyakov, already lost his job, when he dared to apologize for the decision on Facebook.
Anonymous International also jokes that Medvedev opposes Russia's annexation of Crimea, an acquisition that Russians have christened simply "KrymNash," or "Crimea is ours."
Just this week, Medvedev was photographed in Crimea signing a map with this slogan.
And we've come to nothing with the pension system.
Only Belyakov spoke out.
Everyone else chickened out.
Finally we're thinking about banning electricity.
It's more fool-proof. #CrimeaIsntOurs Please retweet.
Some of Anonymous International's tweets through Medvedev's account addressed the prime minister's recent government order imposing new regulations on public wireless Internet access, including the need to supply Internet providers with passport information.
Despite our efforts, certain online hooligans still sh!t on needing to provide their passport number for Wi-Fi access. :( :( :(
And, by the way, concerning "Wi-Fi by passport" and other initiatives my government's led to regulate the Internet.
We were forced to do this .
Many of the hacked tweets simply criticized Russia's leadership—particularly Russia's recent craze for banning things.
Russian citizens shouldn't have to suffer because their leaders have problems with common sense.
We might return to the 1980s.
This is sad.
If this is the goal of my colleagues in the Kremlin, then they'll soon achieve it.
You think anyone in Yalta today will say something important?
I doubt it.
I'm sitting here and thinking to myself, what's the f*cking point?
Maybe it would be better to ban electricity?
I promise that the government will consider such action in the near future.
But it will do so without me.
And Anonymous International would be nothing if it didn't allude to Medvedev's foolish reputation.
This tweet refers to Medvedev's infatuation with photography, perhaps alluding to his infamously embarrassing elevator selfie.
I will become a free photographer.
I've dreamed about it for some time.

Macedonia: Celebrating Basketball Win Over Lithuania · Global Voices
The celebration of the Macedonian entry in the semifinals of the European basketball championship has spilled over from the country's streets, balconies and town squares into the blogosphere.
Ogledalo na edna dusha (Mirror of a Soul) blog posted photos and videos from the celebration of the victory of the Macedonian national team over the host, Lithuania, at the EuroBasket 2011, with levels of euphoria higher than the precedent with Greece.
Barabass considers this win as a defining moment of his generation, "something to tell the grandkids about."
Ruling politicians have scrambled to get on the basketball victory bandwagon.
The president already gave a medal to the national team in absentia, while the government used taxpayers' money to buy tickets for 150 hand-picked "professional fans" to go to the game.
Citizens privately voiced frustration over the brazen lack of transparency and accountability, especially because some of the pro-government media used the phrase "at its own expense," as if the ministers were paying from their own pockets.
The charter flight for this allegedly politically-connected group was sponsored by the Turkish company TAV, a a major investor in Macedonia.
According to Netpress , the "select" mob had a fight on the plane and compromised its security, and the airliner refused to accept 11 of them on the return flight.
The state budget also funded celebratory fireworks at Skopje's main square:
Social media users spread the following joke, referring to the general low level of knowledge about Macedonia in geographic terms outside of the Balkan region (most Macedonians who have been abroad can share a story about meeting people who had no clue where it was, or said it was an island in Africa or something to that effect).
- Where are you from?
- From Macedonia.
- And where is Macedonia?
- In the semifinals!!!
Twitter user Biljana also noted that the celebrations also spread to Serbia - a historic first gesture of "reciprocity."
Most Macedonian sports fans traditionally root for all ex-Yugoslav teams that make it to international competitions, when they don't compete against Macedonia.
Twitter users in the past few days have however, expressed aggravation due to the uncalled-for demeaning comments in some media from these countries.

Egypt: Protesters Bring Down Israel Embassy Security Wall and Flag · Global Voices
Thousands of protesters took to Tahrir Square, the epicentre of the Egyptian revolution in downtown Cairo, today in protest against Egypt's military rulers.
Soon, crowds of young men swarmed to the Israeli Embassy, where they tore down a security wall built to protect the Embassy, and brought down the Israeli flag, as chaos continued into the night.
Here's a snippet of how the events played out on Twitter.
This is the second time in a month that protestors scale the 15-storey Embassy building to remove the Israeli flag.
Reports say that four protesters climbed the building today.
Five hours ago Al Jazeera's correspondent Sherine Tadros reported:
@SherineT: Heading to israeli embassy where reportedly protesters trying to tear down wall #egypt
Mahmoud Abu Sharkh shares a photograph of protesters at the Israel Embassy breaking the security wall.
An hour later, she noted:
@SherineT: Waving the #palestinian flag on top of demolished wall infront of #israel embassy, #egypt
And about two hours ago, she added:
@SherineT: Hundreds headed towards israeli embassy..people all over the streets shouting and chanting #egypt #tahrir
A few minutes later, Tadros tweeted:
@SherineT: Protesters threw israeli flag off the side of the bldg which houses #israel embassy
Salma Said quipped: @SalmaSaid: The Israeli flag was thrown at us from up
Lobna Darwish shares this picture on Twitter of an Egyptian man carrying the Israel Embassy plaque
And Mosa'ab Elshamy added:
@mosaabrizing: It's like a party up there.
The flagMEN waving to protesters from balcony under #IsraeliEmbassy, fireworks and all.
Raafat joked : @Raafatology: The Israeli Embassy should hoist a cucumber next time, so that its flag is not burnt this way everyday.
Others on Twitter as not as ecstatic.
Gigi Ibrahim tweeted:
@Gsquare86: Seriously there is no point to stay at #IsraelEmbassy tonight, we did it all: the flag&wall r down, ppl r almost in emb, csf truck burned
And Dina Salah, from Cairo, added:
@Sonadina: Gotta say I'm not impressed that my tax money will go to the rebuilding of #IsraeliEmbassy wall by el Me2awleen el 3arab (Arab Contractors), tomorrow morning.
The situation continues to unfold.
Gigi reported:
@Gsquare86: The papers r being thrown out of balcony from flat beneath #IsraelEmbassy ..
People fightig after papers as they come down #hilarious
Hisham Al Miraat added:
@_Hisham: Al Jazeera correspondent says Israeli embassy not stormed but rather a lower floor used to archive docs from embassy.

Omar noted:
@beirutwhat: Re: Israeli embassy in Cairo.
SCAF will show the video in every western capital to justify their control over politics.
And Foreign Policy magazine managing editor Blake Hounshell explained:
@blakehounshell: The near storming of the Israeli Embassy tonight will sour a lot of people on the Egyptian Revolution.
Fallout unclear.
USA: The Real and Digital Unite for Latin American Literature · Global Voices
La Casa Azul - an online bookstore that is administrated by Aurora Anaya-Cerda - has recently announced it is going to collaborate with a new bookstore located in Washington Heights, New York.
Word Up (@wordupbooks) has two goals: to spread Latin American literature and independent bookstores.
La Casa Azul has not only been awarded several times, but it also has done some remarkable work.
In a Latina Book Club interview, Aurora explains that her digital platform has had books – and audiobooks - in Spanish and English since 2008.
Aurora also organizes a reading club in the Museo del Barrio, in New York City, since the club was opened, where people can have a conversation with different writers.
The special guest for the next gathering will be Esmeralda Santiago who will talk about her new novel Conquistadora.
Although the Word Up story is a little bit different, it is also incredible.
Months ago, Veronica Liu, the co founder of Fractious Press and Seven Stories Press editorial, met with the Northern Manhattan Arts Alliance and Vantage Residential people in order to analyze the possibility of creating a community bookstore.
This goal was attained.
The following video by ArtbyDJBoy shows the tremendous energy this space has inspired:
We also include a request link to support this club as a permanent project, since it is temporary.
As a matter of fact, the association between both bookstores has been remarkable.
Like the Casa Azul online bulletin informs, it released its new bilingual magazine The Rio Grande Review which was created by the creative writing students in the University of Texas, in El Paso.
You can see the online version of the magazine here.
You can visit both bookstores, either the real or the digital one.
Indonesia: Suicide Bomb Blast at Protestant Church · Global Voices
Another suicide bomb blast occurred on Sunday (September 25) in Solo, Central Java in Indonesia.
The bombing happened in Kepunton Protestant Church, right after the morning Sunday service when the congregation was departing.
As of this writing, 20 people were reported injured and two were killed in the bombing.
The bomber was among the casualties.
President Susilo Bambang said that they found the similarity between the Solo bombing and the one that blew up in Cirebon six months ago, and according to the preliminary investigation of the police, the blast was intended to harm as many churchgoers as possible.
Twitter users in Solo and elsewhere are extending their condolences and expressing their disappointment over this tragic event.
Here are some reactions from twitter users using the hashtags #prayforsolo and #pray4solo:
@inyourdeathbed: stupid suicide bomber, you have accomplished NOTHING but remind us that our current government administration is a TOTAL FAILURE. #BomSolo

Ukraine: Protesting the Controversial Defamation Bill · Global Voices
A draft law that calls for penalties of up to five years in jail for defamation passed a first reading in the Ukrainian Parliament on Sep. 18, with 244 MPs from the ruling Party of Regions and their allies voting in its favor.
Ukrainian citizens and media outlets launched an online campaign against the adoption of the bill, forcing its author, MP Vitaly Zhuravsky, to submit a request to recall the law on Sep. 25 .
Below are excerpts from the July 31 Reporters Without Borders' appeal to the Ukrainian Parliament regarding plans to "recriminalize defamation" in Ukraine:
It is more than 10 years since the Ukrainian Parliament decriminalized defamation.
When it adopted its new criminal code in January 2001, Ukraine took an encouraging first step towards greater protection for freedom of expression, which is indispensible for democratic debate.
Draft law 11013, presented by Vitaly Zhuravskiy, a member of the Party of Regions, and aiming to recriminalize defamation, is a dangerous backward step.
We believe its adoption would be a serious blow to freedom of the press.
The lack of clarity surrounding the definition of defamation, which the bill describes as “disseminating false information, insulting the honour and dignity of a person or damaging his or her reputation", arouses fears of abuse resulting from varying interpretations.
Criminal proceedings could be taken against journalists for publishing articles on the activities of politicians or influential businessmen.
Where journalists face imprisonment for publishing investigative stories, this puts the very operation of an independent media under threat.
Mr. Zhuravskiy says he took his inspiration for drafting the bill from neighbouring Russia, which approved a law on 13 July recriminalizing defamation.
We should like to remind members of Parliament that this was condemned by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and that it seriously damaged that country’s international reputation.
Reporters Without Borders urges you to abandon this bill, which appears to us to be repressive, punitive and counter-productive.
And here is an explanation of why the bill should not be adopted, published in the "Say 'No' to Defamation Law" Facebook group (7,334 members):
Ukrainian journalists believe that this law would be used selectively against those who are publishing critical stories targeting the regime.
It would eliminate the freedom of speech in Ukraine, as many journalists would be forced to stop criticizing the regime in any way that might later be deemed defamatory.
This law concerns not only the journalists but all citizens - because any public statement or commentary published in the mass media might be counted as defamation if a court rules it damaging to a person's honor and dignity.
Taking into account the state of the judicial system in Ukraine, this law presents a significant threat to the civil society as a whole.
Say no to the defamation law!
On Sep. 25, many Ukrainian news websites placed this banner in order to draw attention to the defamation bill and the ongoing protest against it:
"Defend your right to know.
Say 'no' to the defamation law."
The banner linked to a page with work email addresses and phone numbers of the MPs who had voted in favor of the defamation law; netizens were urged to contact these MPs and ask them to explain their decision to vote for the adoption of the controversial bill.
On Facebook, journalist Mustafa Nayyem wrote this about the effect that the "banner protest" had on the Ukrainian lawmakers - and made a mock proposal on how to keep them within legal boundaries in the future:
Vitaly Zhuravsky recalled the defamation bill after the very first day of the banner protest...
Listen, maybe next time we shouldn't waste our time on trifles - let's make a truly large banner and put the texts of the Constitution, the Ten Commandments and the Convention on Human Rights on it?
It appears that the defamation bill isn't history yet, however.
Natalka Zubar, executive editor of Maidan.org.ua, wrote this in the "Say 'No' to Defamation Law" Facebook group:
According to Ukrainian law bills cannot be recalled by the author.
Parliament should vote to reject the bill.
Facebook user Yuriy Loginov added :
lets hope Rada votes to reject the bill... it is interesting that the recall came right before visit to the US, it seems that the current administration is just trying to score points with the US
In response to "numerous messages" that were sent to politicians as part of the "banner protest," Oleksiy Kunchenko, one of the Party of Regions' MPs, quoted the defamation bill's author on his Facebook page ; among other things, MP Zhuravsky mentioned the upcoming parliamentary vote as the reason to reverse his position:
"Having considered and acting in the interest of the state, I have decided to recall my draft law.
I understand that on the eve of the any initiative is perceived with suspicion and distrust" .
Serhiy Petrov, member of the Board at Wikimedia Ukraine, wrote this in the "Say 'No' to Defamation Law" Facebook group:
The defamation law "will definitely be adopted after the election."
This is yet another confirmation that the action has to go on until the Parliament has rejected this draft law.
If they try to push it through once again, alarms should be sounded right away and banners should return.
One option is to announce a blackout before and on the day of the vote.
Of course, this would mean the loss of money , but it looks like there's no other way out...
By the way, various language segments of Wikipedia resorted to such measures on three occasions...
And so the protest against the defamation bill continues.
A rally is scheduled to take place in Kyiv on Monday, Oct. 1, at 10 AM. The newest rendition of the black-and-white banner that many Ukrainian websites are carrying now (e.g., here and here) urges citizens to gather in front of the Parliament with white (blank) posters, to "defend their right to know":
World: Mourning the Execution of Troy Davis · Global Voices
Despite the reprieve granted to Troy Davis earlier today, just over four hours after our last report, Davis was executed.
Around the world, and particularly in the United States, Twitter is in a state of morning.
The hashtag #RIPTroyDavis is currently trending, and individuals are expressing their feelings about Davis's case, as well as about the state of capital punishment in the United States.
From Philadelphia, @ShamaraOnAir reports:
Watching CNN 11:08 was time of death #RIPTROYDAVIS
From Iowa, @Jasminenkelly tweets:

Journalist Dan Gillmor rails against the death penalty, saying:
Bad enough that death penalty exists.
But tonight, our system of "justice" killed another person whose guilt was hugely in doubt.
Travesty.
From Barbados, @bajanswaggboy remarks:
#RIPTroyDavis.
No murder weapon, no DNA, 7 of 9 witnesses recant their testimonies.
Seriously?
How do you execute someone without evidence?
And from the UK, @tweety_coco says:
Still in shock.
Just cannot believe this can happen in 2011. #riptroydavis
Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour), a Palestinian-American activist, states:
#TroyDavis will be the fuel I need to continue my quest for social justice.
He will never be forgotten. #RIPTroyDavis
While the case of Troy Davis has certainly drawn interest from the public, many are cynical that the case is a one-off, and that US citizens will not continue to fight against the death penalty.
Or as Palestinian @Falasteeni put it shortly before the execution took place:
What saddens me most abt expected murder of #TroyDavis is tht nothing will happen, no movement will grow to make sure it never happens again
China: "Do you have memories from before you were kidnapped?" · Global Voices
If you’ve ever visited a Chinese city, you will see children begging or performing with musical instruments near train stations or on crowded streets for spare change.
What you’ve witnessed is the tip of a serious and tough problem in China – the kidnapping and selling of children.
In early 2009, the public security authorities in China have implemented an anti-kidnapping campaign.
At the end of 2010, official figures (not necessarily reliable) showed that 9,165 cases of trafficked women and 5,900 cases of trafficked children were uncovered; 9,388 children and 17,746 women were rescued, and 3,573 criminal kidnapping gangs were destroyed.
The true number of kidnapped children is likely to be much higher than the number rescued.
According to some estimates, as many as 70,000 children in China are abducted by gangs each year.
What is fuelling this child kidnapping?
Thanks to the one-child policy, and Chinese traditions placing huge pressure on families to have sons, stolen children are often sold into new families.
On the other hand, kidnapped girls are often sold into areas where there is a surplus of unmarried men.
Still many others are sold into street performance, begging or prostitution.
Telling their story
The child kidnapping issue is the theme of an upcoming documentary called “Living with Dead Hearts: The Search for China's Kidnapped Children” by Charles Custer.
Custer is an American strongly interested in China.
Currently based in Beijing, he runs the successful blog ChinaGeeks, which offers translation and analysis of the China blogosphere.
For his documentary, Custer wants to go beyond statistics and analysis.
By focusing on the personal and emotional side of the stories, he wants to attach real faces to these social problems.
At the end of last year, Custer launched a fundraising appeal on Kickstarter to make the documentary.
Following generous responses of more than 100 people, the project has successfully raised more than $8,500, and Custer has since then spent much of his free time tracking, interviewing and filming parents and kidnapped children.
This month, the film crew has put together an update together with an early trailer of the film:
Their goal is for viewers abroad to be able to relate to Chinese people as individuals after watching the documentary.
They would be able to see, for example, how the parents of kidnapped children feel with questions like, "When did you discover your daughter was missing?
Could you tell us more about your daughter’s character and hobbies?
What methods have you tried to look for her apart from reporting to the police and the school?
How do you plan to keep looking?"
Or how kidnapped children feel as adults: "Do you have memories from before you were kidnapped?
Do your current “parents” remember from whom you were purchased?
And how do they feel about it now?"
If you care about this issue, you can see how Custer is progressing on the documentary at the dedicated website www.livingwithdeadhearts.com, or learn more about kidnapped children in a special section of ChinaGeeks.org.
If you wish to show your support, visit the Chinese charities Baby Come Home and Xinxing Aid, which support kidnapped and street children in various ways.

Computer science legend Dennis Ritchie died on October 8, 2011 in his home in New Jersey at the age of 70, leaving behind a legacy of enormous impact on global development.
Ritchie was the developer of the C programming language, one of the most widely used programming languages of all time.
According to Xeni Jardin of BoingBoing on October 12, one of the first to report the news publicly was Canadian software engineer Rob Pike via Google+.
Like Ritchie, he is known for his work at Bell Labs.
She wrote (quoting a C programming pun from Twitter):
One of the few public photos of Dennis Ritchie (1941-2011).
Source: Wikipedia (Public Domain)
He was the designer and original developer of the C programming language, and a central figure in the development of Unix.
He spent much of his career at Bell Labs.
He was awarded the Turing Award in 1983, and the National Medal of Technology in 1999.
"Ritchie's influence rivals Jobs'; it's just less visible," James Grimmelman observed on Twitter.
"His pointer has been cast to void *; his process has terminated with exit code 0."
The official blog of Taxgedo (a web application to make word clouds) used the words from Ritchie's seminal textbook "The C Programming language" to create a word cloud as a tribute, and wrote: We lost a tech giant today.
Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie, co-creator of Unix and the C programming language with Ken Thompson, has passed away at the age of 70.
Ritchie has made a tremendous amount of contribution to the computer industry, directly and indirectly affecting (improving) the lives of most people in the world, whether you know it or not.
A commenter in a science and technology news forum on Overclock.net named Andygoyap even compared him to Sir Isaac Newton, one of the most important physicists and mathematicians in history.
Isaac Newton once said he stood on the shoulders of giants.
Dennis Ritchie was a giant on whose shoulders people like Steve Jobs stood on.
....
You don't know him?
He is the Father of C, without him Operating Systems (Windows, Apple) wouldn't be here; Games, Programs, Apps on your Apple, Android, wouldn't exist.
Many say he is the Father of Computer Science, He has so many achievements...
Anyone who hasn't studied basic programming (with some version of C as their first object-oriented programming language) might find it hard to grasp the importance of such a modest and private person.
Ritchie neither flaunted his achievements nor became a business icon.
Most modern computer operating systems such as GNU/Linux and Apple's Mac OS directly descend from UNIX.
Computers running UNIX or GNU/Linux basically provide the infrastructure for the Internet, either as servers or routers, or platforms for running applications like Google web search.
Blog Action Day 2011: Let's All Talk About Food · Global Voices
Blog Action Day is an annual event that unites the world’s bloggers in posting about the same issue on the same day.
Its aim is to raise awareness and trigger a global discussion around an important issue that impacts us all.
On Global Voices, we have covered past Blog Action Days and helped share stories about water in 2010 and climate change in 2009.
This year the topic is food, as the Blog Action Day coincides with World Food Day, an event organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization.
Global Voices authors have written a lot about food already.
Most recently, its special coverage about the United Nations Millenium Development Goals in 2011 includes a series of posts about the struggle to end famine and alleviate poverty.
Our community was also commissioned to create a series of posts on Food Insecurity with the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.
Our reports draw on citizen media and are featured on the Pulitzer Gateway to Food Insecurity.

An open invitation to anyone with a blog is on the Blog Action Day website.
You can find a list of suggested topics here; some of them include famine in East Africa, hunger and poverty, malnutrition and conflicts over food.
But if you prefer not to get too serious for Blog Action Day, you can also write about your favorite foods, organic food or vegetarianism.
There's a lot to say about food, and the topic breaks down in many different occasions and issues:
We use food to mark times of celebration and sorrow.
Lack of access to food causes devastating famines, whilst too much is causing a generation of new health problems.
It can cost the world, or be too cheap for farmers to make a living.
The way we companies produce food and drinks can provide important jobs for communities or be completely destructive to habitats and local food producers.
Food can give us energy to get through the day or contain ingredients that gives us allergic reactions.
Food can cooked by highly skilled chefs with inventive flair, or mass produced and delivered with speed at the side of road.
It can be incredibly healthy or complete junk and bad for your health.
It can taste delicious or be a locals only delicacy.
Food is important to our culture, identity and daily sustenance and the team at Blog Action invite you to join us to talk about food
If you are interested, read more about food from the perspective of the Global Voices community.

Hungary: "How Many Policemen Does It Take to Arrest A Homeless Person?" · Global Voices
In fact, it was Attila Kopiás, blogging under the name of KA_Steve , who pretended to be homeless and, with the help of Kettős Mérce's bloggers, recorded what happened after they had called the police and reported that there was a homeless person on a bench of a District VIII square.
The issue generated a huge debate after the mayor of the district, through a referendum, had banned homeless people from public spaces in September.
Bloggers followed the cases happening in District VIII and published an order prosecuting a homeless man for "sitting on the stone with some of his fellows."
The regulation literally forbids "staying in public space as a lifestyle."
Attila Kopiás told the bloggers of Kettős Mérce in an interview that he tried not to lie to the police, so when they asked him if he stayed at a public place "as a lifestyle" he replied that "it had happened before that I slept in a public place".
He told Kettős Mérce:
I didn't have any elaborate strategy, I was simply disgusted by the fact that people are not punished for their acts but for their condition.
The idea came from me feeling an urge to do something against this unfair system.
In addition to this, my mind was not able to accept that in 2011, in Hungary, it can happen that one can be arrested and handcuffed for notorious sitting/lying on a bench.
I reckoned with nobody taking care of me, and I simply wanted to see what really happens.
Commenting on the action, KA_Steve raised the question of what differentiates someone having a picninc at a public space from a homeless.
Reflecting this, a version of 'Picnic in May' - originally a painting by a 19th-century Hungarian artist - started to circulate on Facebook, published originally by the Tumblr user Prolidepp.
KA_Steve called for action on his blog , sharing legal ways to protest the regulation that punishes those who live on the streets, move a trash can or engage in begging.
Attila wrote this on Kettős Mérce:
But I want them to know there are people who stand up for them.
The way we all want someone to stand up for us when we are in trouble.
Macedonia: Software Freedom Day · Global Voices
As part of the global Software Freedom Day, Free Software Macedonia for the third time has organized an event in the center of Skopje.
4, they distributed leaflets and disks with Ubuntu Linux, which were prepared specifically for this occasion and included free software applications for other operating systems as well as a movie on the Swedish piracy culture, “Steal This Film.”
The event started on the square, and included a group of artists who collaborated on a painting dedicated and inspired by this day.
On the blog of Free Software Macedonia, the members wrote (MKD):
The canvas attracted the attention of the people on the square, although there were more events happening at the same time.
The artist started working immediately, and soon there was “free software” on the canvas.
They were satisfied with the response of the people and the event (MKD):
We gave information to a lot of people, and some of them even stopped and asked questions.
There were people who came with concrete questions, but most people had general interest in the event and the activities.
Overall, the event was better than expected.
Probably some of the people, who really got interested in free software culture, will come sometimes to “Share Knowledge” or “Share Movie”, where we can make deeper contact.
Free Software Macedonia every week organizes events like “Share Knowledge,” where they are sharing their knowledge, experiment and discuss with the people interested in free software, and “Share Movie,” where they are showing interesting presentations, open content films and YouTube playlists.
At these events anyone is welcome and can attend free of charge.

Canada: Indigenous Femicide on the Spotlight · Global Voices
Through Women Make Movies we were made aware about a Canadian documentary which is bringing to public attention the disappearances and murders of more than 500 aboriginal women in Canada in the past 30 years.
The film is called Finding Dawn by Christine Welsh.
The movie is named after Dawn Crey, who was the 23rd victim whose DNA was recognized in the largest serial murder investigation in Canada back in 2002-2004.
The film focuses on this story and others, as well as the reports and complaints regarding the authorities' inaction regarding the murders and disappearances of these native Canadian women and the struggles the families of these women face on their road to find justice.
The clips to this film and others relating to femicide (the killing of women and girls) can be found in the Citizen Shift website's dossier on the subject.
The first clip from Finding Dawn shows the case of Dawn Crey in Vancouver:

The second video shows us Yellowhead Highway, a lonely stretch of road that connects many different towns, where so many women have disappeared or been killed that it has become known as the Highway of Tears.

The third and last clip from the movie focuses on Doleen Kay Bosse, a woman whose family has spent years searching for an explanation to her disappearance, wondering why the authorities haven't taken seriously the reports of missing aboriginal women.

Arabeyes: Here Comes the One-Eye Veil · Global Voices
From a veil which covers the face but allows women to show their two eyes, an Islamic scholar from Saudi Arabia is now calling for a veil which shows one eye only.
Bloggers from the Arab world react.
Writing in Mideast Youth, Bahraini Esra'a notes:
In order to remedy his disturbing temptations, Saudi cleric Muhammad al-Habadan proposes a highly convenient solution for women: one-eyed veil.
She continues:
Great!
I’ll start drilling a hole in my bed sheets right away.
But in all seriousness, such disturbing calls only further objectifies women, inviting “religious” clerics to harass and disrespect them in ways that are no longer acceptable. I have a more fitting proposal for clerics in favor of this bogus call; gouge your eyes out with a tack hammer if you wish to refrain from being seduced.
Women should no longer pay the price of your disturbing and sickening mentalities.
From Morocco, Myrtus is fuming, describing the ruling as an 'Islamically incorrect fatwa.' She also asks:
I wonder how many women would like to poke Sheikh Mohamed's other eye out for his asinine fatwa.
Palestinian Haitham Sabbah describes the one-eye veil as 'ridiculous.'
He says:
This is just getting out of hand.
Ridiculous…
He continues:
Why don’t they enforce full-face cover and kill the issue?
What do you call this?
Religion and Islam?
No Way!
Oh… by the way… anyone knows which eye should be covered?
Left of right?
(I assumed left because they keep on telling us to do things with our RIGHT thing… Ah… now I’m getting the rule.
“Do the Right things with the RIGHT things only.” This is where the Human “Rights” came from and here we see it in action.
Long live “One-Eye Veil.”
Sabbah also posts pictures of how women wearing the one-eyed veil would look like here.
Venezuela: Twitter Users Detained After Socialist Party Deputy is Slain · Global Voices

Over the last three weeks, several Twitter users have been detained by Venezuelan authorities for making online comments that police allege tie them to the murder of 27-year-old Socialist Party deputy Robert Serra, who was stabbed to death in his home on Oct. 1, 2014.
Serra's assassination shook the country's increasingly embattled political leadership and further stoked the already-high tensions between authorities and opposition party members.
Although two men, both reportedly Serra's bodyguards, have been detained as suspects in his killing, numerous other citizens have been detained in connection with the incident.
At least two individuals were detained in connection with the @Hiipolita Twitter account, where an alleged fortune teller foresaw “mourning" in the National Assembly.
The National Assembly will be in MOURNING!
Although the account has been silent since Oct. 14, its more recent tweets included concerns about economic and social conditions in the country, numerous retweets of opposition political leaders such as Leopoldo López and Henrique Capriles, and general predictions of hard times ahead.
Several other individuals have been detained for tweets that authorities claim link them to Serra's death: On October 14, Ginette Hernández, community manager at the television channel E!
Entertainment Television, and her uncle Lessy Hernańdez were detained in connection with the @Hiipolita account.
Daniely Benítez (@pretinha76), a flutist with the Caracas Marching Band and vocalist of Brazilian music group Só Sambistas, was detained, also in connection with @Hiipolita.
Benítez stands accused by Diosdado Cabello, president of the National Assembly and a steadfast Chavez supporter.
She has since been released and her detention declared wrongful.
7, Scientist Inés Margarita González was detained and charged with inciting crime via messages published on her account regarding her opinion on the death of Serra.
She has been incommunicado since her arrest.
8, Abrahan David Muñoz (@abrahamdz) was arrested and detained.
He faces the same charges as González, also concerning his comments regarding Serra’s death.
Muñoz was taken to the intelligence headquarters (SEBIN) in Caracas, but was later released on probation.
13, Víctor Ugas was detained for spreading pictures of Robert Sierra’s body, allegedly taken at the morgue.
Ugas is being charged with improper disclosure of data and espionage.
Global Voices Advocacy obtained information about these detentions through local sources in Venezuela.
Unfortunately, there is little more information about these individuals that can be confirmed at this time.
Given the risk of speculating or publishing unconfirmed information about the fate of the detainees, we have chosen simply to report what we know.
The government has also blocked the news portal Infobae, which published material regarding Serra’s homicide, including pictures of his body.
CONATEL president William Castillo wrote:
Following instructions, due to serious violations of the Venezuelan laws, Conatel ordered blocking the website http://t.co/RDqpeaR3Se
Since the adoption of the Law on Social Responsibility in Radio, Television and Electronic Media, CONATEL (an administrative body, dependent on the President) has had the power to block web content without trial.
Though the Venezuelan government has been prone to detaining social media users in the past, it seems that their policies have tightened over the last year, with the wave of blockades in relation to the black market dollar, and filtering measures taken this year at the height of the student protests.
Global Handwashing Day: Changing Behaviors through Song and Dance · Global Voices
Logo for the Global Handwashing Day
Do you know how to properly wash your hands?
Through song and dance, people from different parts of the world are teaching others the right way to wash their hands to promote health.
October 15, 2011, is Global Handwashing Day, and with the slogan "Clean Hands Save Lives", it puts the spotlight on a simple action that helps decrease child mortality due to preventable diseases. Hip hop Grammy winners Chocquibtown from Colombia, tell children when to wash their hands and how to do it.
Many different organizations are promoting handwashing in different parts of the world. In the next videos we see the Red Cross' efforts in Haiti to promote handwashing through songs in Creole, Food for the Hungry in Mozambique shows us a handwashing station that uses a gallon plastic bottle as a water source and shares the song Mozi's Water, which lasts as long as handwashing should. Foundations Surtigas and Promigas in Colombia have empowered children to express themselves through writing, painting, poetry and singing, with some of the children composing pieces on handwashing and singing in the traditional regional style of Vallenato.
Health practitioners in Iligan City, Philippines also made their own choreographed handwashing video to the beat of Jai Ho, from the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. Let's go wash our hands!
Journalist Asteris Masouras Hopes Solidarity Will Save Greece · Global Voices

Used with permission.
His brief biography on Twitter reads: "social justice/stay human."
And Asteris Masouras is a true humanist.
For this reason, he hopes that the socioeconomic crisis plaguing his home country of Greece—and which also threatens to spread throughout Europe—can eventually be solved through solidarity and a compromise with justice.
Asteris is an engineer and photojournalist.
As editor of Global Voices in Greek, he has covered popular uprisings in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria, and the rest of the Middle East and North Africa.
Over the past few months in Thessaloniki (Greece's second largest city), he has devoted himself to following the debt crisis, the impact of austerity measures, and the reactions in the streets.
In an interview with Global Voices, Asteris analyzes the Greek crisis, its roots, and its possible ramifications.

Global Voices (GV): How has Thessaloniki responded since the referendum?
AM: The city's downtown was practically empty all day Sunday while the referendum was taking place.
The majority of people got together next to the beach, enjoying the days' sea breeze, almost as if trying to savor a few moments of peace before hearing the news.
The celebration of the "no" vote exploded hours later, right next to that same beach.
GV: What are your thoughts on the results?
AM: Developments over the last few days, and their results, give us hope to be able to come face-to-face with hostile negotiations, and seek out a fairer deal.
The "no" vote held strong throughout the entire country; however, this was seen overwhelmingly in the poorest neighborhoods; the ones who most suffered from the austerity measures.
Meanwhile, the majority who voted "yes" came from the rich neighborhoods.
61 percent of Greeks said "no" to the destructive austerity ultimatum amidst an environment of capital control and brutal harassment brought upon by the media and institutions.
GV: Tell us more about the media's role, especially regarding the last few months.
AM: The Greek mass media has outdone itself in terms of propaganda, and in the way it spreads fear so that people are unable to think clearly during the most critical moment in the recent history of Greek democracy (and perhaps Europe's as well).
Instead of sensibly reporting on the problems that are affecting Greeks, and the decisions that they make of their own free will, it has denied the people any form of agency, imposing upon them an agenda that is clearly rooted in commercial interests.
Corruption in Greece is endemic, planting its roots in the interests of media owners and elite politicians.
But the referendum has shown that the Greeks are ready to face them and will not be so easily intimidated.
GV: In Spain, there has been a lot of focus on the relationship between Greek political party Syriza and Spanish political party Podemos ("We Can") and the way in which the success of one determines that of the other.
What do you think these results mean for Spain?
AM: It's obvious that the institutional tough negotiation measures against Greece have a lot to do with wanting to avoid the "contagion effect."
Greece is being punished for having voted for Syriza and defying the dominant discourse.
Mariano Rajoy's attacks against Greece and the coalition government that have done so much damage to Greece, as well as to the European Union, has a lot to do with fear of Podemos; but I think there might be backlash against the Spanish government if the Greek referendum ends up benefiting Podemos.
GV: We met right before the 2011 protests in the Middle East, Spain, and other countries.
Many things have changed since then.
Is Greece the latest episode of public discontent?
AM: In a way, yes, although the Greeks' anger over corruption and neo-liberal politics comes before the Arab Spring and the "indignant" movements.
The workers' movement and protests in Greece have been growing over the years against patronage and bipartisan politics.
With the crisis and austerity measures, the two-party system including New Democracy and PASOK (the top two historical parties in Greece) has been dissolving; and the people have come together with the indignation movement, which has since then sparked the rest of the regions' protests.
GV: What do you hope for in the coming months?
AM: I wish for institutions to put an end to the offensive against Greece; for them to realize that austerity measures are destroying European societies; and for them to allow fair treatment that will let my country get back on its feet.
However, surely it's naive to think that reason and humanity will prevail in the same institutions that have clashed with the social justice movements, so, I hope that at least there will be solidarity among our people, the people of Europe, and the refugees arriving to our countries on a daily basis.
Perhaps this can counteract the damage and destruction imposed by our leaders before it's too late for the European Union and the rest of the continent.
Macedonian Activist Ends Hunger Strike for Migrant Rights · Global Voices
On Saturday, June 20, human rights expert and activist Suad Missini ended the hunger strike he started six days prior in protest of inhumane treatment of migrants passing through Macedonia.
Mr. Missini issued the following statement :
While the effects of the changes of the Asylum Law are yet to be seen in practice, the conditions in the migrant center in Gazi Baba has not been improved.
The refugees are still kept in the center which gains characteristics of a concentration camp, under impossible, inhuman and degrading conditions, out of the legal framework and international human rights standards which are part of the national legal system.
Authorities in Republic of Macedonia chose to remain deaf to the demands for solving of this problem by numerous international organizations and institutions.
They act blind to the fact that the UN Committee Against Torture characterized the treatment of refugees in this center as torture and breach of the UN Convention Against Torture in its latest report. And all this while our country is a member of the UN Human Rights Council.
On the other hand, I'd like to stress that Macedonia, as member of Council of Europe (CoE), received a visit by the CoE Committee for Prevention of Torture, which included a visit to Gazi Baba center.
This summer, the president of this committee Mikola Gnatovskij visited Macedonia and also talked to the authorities about this center, among other things.
I emphasize that Macedonian authorities have still not issued approval for the report of this visit to be published.
Finally, two days before the start of the hunger strike, the Ombudsman of Republic of Macedonia presented the catastrophic situation and lawlessness that rule in this center.
Today, we can acknowledge that the public in Republic of Macedonia, as well as the international public and foreign media and organizations, are fully aware and informed about the problem with this center.
These days, Gazi Baba center is an international topic.
If the government decided that this catastrophic problem should not be a subject of immediate reaction and subsequent solution, then this definitely puts our country among those which openly and unscrupulously conduct torture, while the authorities are legitimized as institutions lead by persons which have no respect for human lives.
The lives of hundreds of people detained within this center.
And finally, about my life.
Therefore, on this day I end the hunger strike.
Because the limits of health risks are already surpassed, and because the potentials of this strike are fulfilled.
My demands, which are demands by an enormous part of the public in Republic of Macedonia, are partially fulfilled.
My civic act was a drop which made waves, which, I sincerely hope, together with all the other efforts, will lead to solving of this problem which turns our country into an uncivilized space.
I am immensely grateful to the thousands who sincerely and unambiguously expressed their support, making this civil act as much theirs, as it was mine.
Meanwhile, Twitter users continue sharing leaked photos showing the conditions of detained refugees.
Unlivable Conditions in Macedonian Student Dorms Worsen · Global Voices
The Student Plenum, a grassroots movement fighting for the rights of university students in Macedonia, published new photos of the unlivable conditions that students in Macedonia's capital of Skopje live in.
The movement has steadily been following the situation in the state-owned student dorms and has called on the state several times to improve basic hygiene and safety conditions in the student living quarters.
Student Plenum recently informed the public that the living conditions and structural safety of at least one of the largest student dormitories in Skopje has worsened since and has reminded that the government promised to fully reconstruct the dorms more than a year ago, after being shamed in international media.
In the accompanying text, Student Plenum indirectly address the new institution of special public prosecutor, which is supposed to handle corruption cases that the regular public prosecutor in Macedonia actively ignores.
Student dorms are falling apart just like the state system and we have not received a new special student dorm to save the students' lives from the misery in which they live and which crumbles around them.
This is the Block V of the "Goce Delchev" student dorm. The ceiling fell in one of the hallways a few days ago.
This time no one was injured.
Will our colleagues be so lucky the next time or by then will they get a new, (special) student dorm?

Since the beginning of his term in late 2012, Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto has been committed to creating and broadcasting an image of a country moving forward.
The government has enacted structural reforms with support from the opposition.
The government's strategy to deal with the country's security crisis, however, and the international community's human rights stance have been called into question following the disappearance of 43 students from the state of Guerrero.
Miguel Guevara, Global Voices contributor, has written a piece for the blog of Harvard Kennedy School Review titled Mexico’s Loneliness: Our drug wars are not over:
Today, high-ranking US officials have not voiced concerns over the deteriorating events in Mexico since September 26th.
The US response to human rights violations around the globe – including the recent events in Iguala – should be unambiguous and consistent.
Silence is tantamount to complicity.
Laughing at Russia's 2018 World Cup Logo · Global Voices Laughing at the 2018 World Cup logo.
More than 200 miles above the Earth yesterday, humanity got a peek at the official logo of the next FIFA World Cup, which will take place in Russia less than four years from now.
Russia made quite a show of the unveiling, too, tasking the job to its three cosmonauts aboard the International Space Station.
Live video footage of the soccer tournament's logo aired on primetime Russian television. Immediately afterwards, sports officials also blanketed the Bolshoi Theater in an impressive light show, narrating the Cup's migration from Brazil to Russia. Hosting the World Cup, the planet's single most popular sporting event, is sure to be a major moment for Russia on the world stage, where Moscow's reputation has suffered over the past several months, after violence in Ukraine has washed away most of the good will created by the Sochi Winter Olympics.
Good will is also in short supply among Russian social media users, admittedly, and the logo for the 2018 World Cup became the target of mockery the moment it went public.
RuNet Echo presents some of the jokes now circulating on Russian-language Twitter.
World Cup 2018 the other side.
This one is also done quite well. :)
The logo itself isn't actually Russian-made.
The design belongs to BrandiaCentral, a Portugal-based branding agency that beat out six other firms, including some Russian companies.
Russia Step Ups Censorship of ISIS Social Media Content · Global Voices
Russia's new efforts to search for and delete ISIS social media content.
Images edited by Kevin Rothrock.
Its territorial gains over the past year have astounded the world, but some of the most surprising successes for ISIS have come in cyberspace, where the group's social media presence is booming.
Using Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube, as well as various Internet memes, ISIS releases videos and images, often featuring violent scenes of beheadings and torture against Iraqis and Syrians.
Supporters and various twisted Internet users are quick to upload and disseminate this content all around the world.
Al Qaeda spin-off ISIS has come to control one-third of Syria and a quarter of Iraq, unleashing havoc and horror in its path.
It has attracted thousands of youth from around the world, who have been indoctrinated in its extreme ideology, which even the notorious Al Qaeda has found “brutal.”
But what is driving the sudden online expansion of ISIS?
Governments hope that cracking down on its spread in social media will help limit the group's reach ideologically and logistically.
Recently, Russian Duma deputies asked the Attorney General to label extremist all videos by and about ISIS, which would obligate federal censors to ban the publication and sharing of such content.
Last week, officials responded by asking Russia's media oversight agency, Roskomnadzor, to ban access to almost 400 different hyperlinks on Vkontakte and YouTube leading Internet users to the ISIS propaganda film, "Clanging of the Swords."
Earlier today, October 27, the Attorney General appealed to Roskomnadzor again, ordering it to ban seven different pages on Vkontakte for carrying ISIS calls to extremist and terrorist acts.
Roman Khudyakov, the parliament deputy heading the initiative, says free access to sites with ISIS content presents a threat to the Russian state and society, popularizing Islamic fundamentalist ideas.
Khudyakov, citing the presence of Russian subtitles on some of ISIS’s videos, says the materials are aimed at recruiting new members from Russia.
The move to forbid ISIS’s media content joins a broad trend of growing Internet surveillance and censorship in Russia, but the feasibility of weakening ISIS's recruitment efforts by targeting social media is questionable.
Last June, the the security consultancy Soufan Group published a study about the online recruitment efforts of Syrian combatants, finding that new members are often “interconnected within self-selected bubbles.”
In other words, the ISIS videos and memes circulating online might be a mere consequence of preexisting social networks in the offline world, rather than the result of some brilliant social media marketing campaign.
As Global Voices has written in the past, charges of terrorism and extremism are some of the ways police around the world limit free expression and justify the incarceration of social media users.
In Russia, there is a long history of persecuting Muslims, including the use of torture to extract confessions from those suspected of having ties to terrorism.
While Russia's crackdown on ISIS online content might succeed in weakening the group's reach, it will also make ordinary citizens—particularly those who share religious materials online—more vulnerable to new criminal prosecutions, which threaten more arbitrary detentions and mistreatment of prisoners taken into custody.
Balkan Nationalists Bring Back Personality Cults in Tattoos of Ruling Politicians · Global Voices
Tattoos of former political leaders have to become so popular in the Balkans in recent years that it has has launched these leaders into worship-level status.
A previous tattoo tradition, mostly from the 1950s until the late 1980s in former Yugoslav states, was that of emblems and symbols of the Yugoslav People's Army.
Conscripts who had to endure one to two years of mandatory military service often came back with almost prison-like tattoos as mementos.
These included state symbols, images of weapons, or the face of then Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, while his personality cult was still going strong.
After the dissolution of Yugoslavia, images of other historical figures began to appear in tattoo form, in particular on the bodies of young males with a nationalist flare, such as images of 20th century Croatian fascist leader Ante Pavelić among Croats and of Chetnik Serb leader Draža Mihailović among Serbs.
New color techniques began being used for new versions of Tito tattoos as well, among those who remained nostalgic.
Tattoos of Tito (earlier and newer versions), Pavelić, and Mihajlović.
In 2009, Croatian daily Slobodna Dalmacija reported that a man from Banja Luka tattooed the image of contemporary Bosnian-Serb politician Milorad Dodik. The phenomenon of tattooing the faces of contemporary Balkan leaders seemed only to grown stronger after that.
Bosnian Serb politician Dodik's face as tattoo and model photograph.
Current Macedonian right-wing Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski has been in this seat since 2006.
Over the years, some Macedonian social network users have shown their apparent devotion to the leader of Macedonia's ruling VMRO-DPMNE party by posting photos of their tattoos of Gruevski.
One such man had tattooed the Prime Minister's name and surname, along with the letters VMRO and a cross.
Another had Gruevski's face tattooed with an inscription that reads: "Loyal to the grave".
Tattoos showing loyalty to Macedonian Prime Minister Nikola Gruevski.
The most recent example of this phenomenon ended on the front page of the Macedonian newspaper Vest.
A man from Shtip tattooed the faces of the prime minister's cousin and Secret Service chief Sasho Mijalkov, and his son. The tattooed man claimed he's grateful for the help provided by the powerful and wealthy VMRO-DPMNE offical throughout his life.

This revived tradition has been subject to ridicule by humorists in several Balkan countries.
Croatian satirical site News Bar published a fake news piece about Croatian right-wing politician Tomislav Karamarko who, in this piece, asks a tattoo artist to put the image of the "greatest Croatian statesman of the 20th century" on his chest.
Instead of his late party boss and Croatian leader Franjo Tuđman, as expected, he gets a Josip Broz Tito tattoo from the artist.
Macedonian independent political magazine Fokus also posted a a satirical piece recently, poking fun at two trends: the tattoos and the appointment of surprisingly young government ministers with very little prior experience to their name.
After several big fans of VMRO-DPMNE tattooed the images of Gruevski and Sasho Mijalkov on their shoulders, the ruling party decided to meet the needs of the youngest generation for decorating their arms with some of their functionaries.
Therefore, the kids will be able to apply wider range of heroes besides Sponge Bob, Dora the Explorer, Diego, and Tom and Jerry.

Guatemala: Three Generals Finally Arrested and Indicted for Genocide · Global Voices
Update (27 October, 2011):
An earlier version of this post stated that two generals, not three, had been arrested.
The post has been amended accordingly.
Guatemalan courts are set to face a challenge without precedent in the country: prosecuting genocide.
After three decades of failed efforts to prosecute the Guatemalan Army, three generals are finally under arrest, accused of perpetrating genocide and other war crimes against the Maya Ixil people in the years 1982-83 by massacring and burning entire villages.
More arrest warrants will follow.
Former General Hector Lopez Fuentes was the first arrested in connection with genocide in Guatemala.
His arrest was followed by the detention of José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez, now in prison, and Oscar Mejía Victores, who is under hospital arrest whilst he is being evaluated to check if his health will allow him to stand trial, as reported by Mike in the blog Central American Politics.

In the words of the 1999 report by the Commission for Historical Clarification (CEH for its initials in Spanish) :
The Army's perception of Mayan communities as natural allies of the guerrillas contributed to increasing and aggravating the human rights violations perpetrated against them, demonstrating an aggressive racist component of extreme cruelty that led to extermination en masse of defenseless Mayan communities, including children, women and the elderly, through methods whose cruelty has outraged the moral conscience of the civilized world.
NISGUA blog describes:
The members of the military with arrest warrants formed part of the Department of Defense in the de facto government of General Efraín Ríos Montt and actively participated in the intellectual planning of the genocide against the Maya Ixil people through Plan Victoria 82.
Their roles were fundamental in the commission of crimes against humanity and genocide during this time.
Efraín Rios Montt, a former dictator and now member of the Guatemalan Congress, has not been not re-elected and will lose his immunity on January 14, 2012, when his mandate ends.

As the blog Unredacted explains, it is likely that declassified official government records from both Guatemala and the United States will be used as evidence:
In 2009, the National Security Archive introduced Plan Sofía
One of the key records associated with Plan Sofía is a telegram from Army Chief of Staff López Fuentes to the commander of his Special Forces airborne brigade ordering the launching of Operation Sofía in the Ixil region of the Quiché.
The counterinsurgency assault that resulted displaced hundreds of Mayan residents and left an unknown number dead as soldiers destroyed their villages, burned their houses and slaughtered their livestock.
(See summaries of witness testimony and more about the Spanish proceedings here.)
International Law Girls analyzes the importance of this process for the Guatemalan system of justice:
Guatemalan law allows for repeated delays in criminal cases as interlocutory challenges move through a lengthy appeals process.
Many people involved in the genocidal campaigns of the 1980s still hold positions of power – including the country’s frontrunner for the presidency, Otto Perez Molina.
If it is successful, the prosecution will be a breakthrough for the fight against impunity on a scale with the conviction of Peru’s former president Fujimori.
While families of the victims, who are following the hearings closely, applauded the arrests, some citizens strongly oppose the prosecution of the army, arguing that the country has to dedicate efforts to solving current violence and that forgiveness and reconciliation should be the goal.
Others mention that former guerrilla force members should be prosecuted too, arguing that an amnesty should not shield them from the responsibility and involvement in crimes against civilians , although a truth commission found that guerillas only participated in 3% of the crimes, as pointed out by Central American Politics in the post "Why not prosecute guerrillas?".
Amnesty is inapplicable for international crimes, including genocide, torture, and forced disappearance.
The struggle for justice in Guatemala is a heroic effort: less than 5% of cases are prosecuted every year.
It seems that finally decades of effort by victims' associations will deliver justice to the families who survived the war.
World: Yahoo and striptease dance! · Global Voices
Do you recall the golden offer made by Microsoft to acquire Yahoo (more than 44 billion). Yahoo rejected the offer entirely, and its CEO stressed that the idea of selling Yahoo is not suggested in the first place. Yahoo preferred an advertising partnership with Google to take advantage of the online advertising market which is almost controlled by Google alone.
Since sometime, Yahoo is suffering problems of not achieving the required financial returns, and its policy knows alot of confusion. Whether Microsoft's response was a final rejection for the purchase of Yahoo now, or is simply a maneuver to reduce the price; Yahoo has lost much of its value, and likely will sacrifice soon by its CEO, Yahoo Jerry Yang, then Yahoo should exert much effort to recover some of its lost value.
Saudi Arabia: Prince Naif is Coming · Global Voices
It took Saudi netizens only a few minutes to pop up on Twitter with their worries after the death of their late Crown Prince Sultan Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud.
Many of them kept asking the same question - about the identity of their next crown prince - until the news came from the Royal Palace on midnight on October 27, 2011, appointing Prince Naif Bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, the interior minister of the Kingdom since 1978 and the second deputy prime minister, as the next in line to the throne.
It is not as if Saudis didn't see this coming; however, a sort of wishful thinking kept imagining that King Abdullah might choose someone else. Now, with the official news appointing Naif as the crown prince, who will stay in charge of the Interior Ministry as well, Saudis are expecting stronger support for religious authorities and the police, as well as less freedom and more arrests.
Prince Naif has been known for these actions over the past years of his management of the Interior Ministry.
Saudis tweeted this picture of Prince Naif with a quote that shows his opposition to women driving: "I said it in the Shura Council, Women will not drive cars as long as I am alive."
Reactions online
Saudi tweep Ali J. Al-Dawood (@abu_jafar) commented sarcastically on the news, saying the new era might put all Saudis in jail:
@EbtihalMubarak: It's not like Saudis experienced democracy under Abdullah's reign but they're weeping over his soon to end days sums it all.
Another Saudi female tweep called Norah (@Hit_Zero) referred to freedom of speech in Prince Naif's coming era:
Protests as Macedonia's Government Gives a Polluting Factory in Tetovo Another Break · Global Voices
Citizens protesting in Tetovo on Friday, November 7, 2014.
Photo from Facebook by Amir Selimi, used with permission.
Hundreds of residents in northwestern Macedonia protested against their government's decision to extend yet another deadline for the Jugohrom steel factory to install anti-pollution filters at their seven furnaces in Tetovo, the country's most polluted city.
There have been several extensions of this deadline through the years.
The last one was in April 2014 when the plant was granted a 6-month period to undertake necessary measures to reduce pollution.
But the deadline passed and the factory took no steps to comply with environmental standards.
Tetovo residents, who protested earlier when similar promises were broken, took to the streets again on Friday, November 7, 2014.
Jugohrom is identified by experts as a major air polluter in the Pollog region in northwest Macedonia.
The region includes two major cities Tetovo and Gostivar, which have more than 300,000 residents.
Pollution in this region is extremely high and it becomes worse in the winter when heating season begins.
The situation is alarming because the density of air pollution in the region, specifically particulate matter PM10, which the World Health Organization (WHO) says is a harmful air pollutant linked to excessive premature mortality, is currently 8 times higher than permitted limits.
In winter, the density of PM10 in the air can surpass the permitted limit by more than ten times.
The WHO says exposure to high levels of this type of air pollution drastically increases the risk of respiratory infections, heart disease, stroke, and cancer.
Arianit Xhaferi from Eco Guerilla, the organization that organized the protest under the slogans "Don’t Be Silent, Raise Your Voice" and “We want fresh air!” in Tetovo stated:
This is just the beginning; we will protest again and will earnestly seek for fresh air.
We cannot stop our breath, but they can stop the factory with a push of a button.
We will not give up because our demands are legitimate.
Protesters emphasized that they do not want the factory to close for the factory's 1200 workers, but they resolutely want the factory to install filters and undertake all necessary measures to reduce pollution.
Albert Ziberi, a health enthusiast from Tetovo, tweeted:
Let's make this clear, the goal is to install filters not to end jobs!
Many Macedonians are revolted by the government’s attitude and carelessness, narrowing down the health of thousands of citizens to a bureaucracy and deadlines extensions.
Global Voices author Filip Stojanovski responded to questions from regional and international bloggers and media on Twitter, explaining the protests:
The Government of #Macedonia repeatedly extends the deadline for putting filters on factories polluting #Tetovo area. @Balkanist @bjasari — Filip Stojanovski (@razvigor) November 7, 2014
The portal Portalb.mk is covering pollution issues in Macedonia closely and is continuously providing coverage of the protests against air pollution in Tetovo.
In an article entitled “Will the Macedonian Government shorten the life of its citizens” provided a history of the pollution problem along with a list of unfulfilled promises made by the government and the repeated deadline extensions that have been granted for installing filters in polluting factories.
The protests also received notable international attention, the Los Angeles Times published a photo from the protests in Tetovo.
Macedonia: Interior Ministry Responds to Invitation for Debate · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Macedonia Protests 2011.
The response of the Ministry of the Interior to an invitation for public debate on ways to bring about positive social change through civic activism and reform in Macedonia, organized by the Movement Against Police Brutality, has caused an outrage in the Macedonian social media.
The activists of the grassroots Movement Against Police Brutality organized a public debate on November 9, 2011, in Skopje,
...to analyze and publicly discuss the recent events, positive and negative aspects leading to the first more serious civic protests, demanding reform of the Macedonian police and increased respect for human rights.
The way youth expressed their revolt and demands for changes in the system, are part of the issues at hand.
The concept of the debate includes participation of various stakeholders and relevant experts.
Moreover, the latest European Commission Progress Report on Macedonia refers to the case of the murder of Martin Neshkovski, and states the following:
As regards the prevention of torture and ill-treatment and the fight against impunity, legislative provisions in this area are yet to be translated into a consistent and comprehensive practice.
Systemic deficiencies remain with regard to combating impunity within the law enforcement agencies... The effectiveness of prosecutors and judges in taking appropriate action when there are indications of ill-treatment by the police remains a concern...
The debate was supposed to gather at one place the activists, human rights experts, representatives of the Ombudsman of the Republic of Macedonia, the Macedonian Helsinki Committee, and the Minister of the Interior, Ms. Gordana Jankulovska.
The latter did not show up for the debate - according to an Alfa TV news item , she chose to attend a film premiere instead.

Before the event, the organizers published the official response to their invitation from the Sector for Public Relations and Information of Public Character of the Ministry of the Interior:
A scanned version of the response by the Ministry of the Interior
Respected sirs/madams,
We would like to understand your letter as a retraction of the previous protests and untruthful accusations, insults and slander; because we doubt that anyone would like to sit at the same table with “murderers” or “executioners.”
Still, the true retraction from the demeaning and unfounded qualifications should come at least in the form of a public apology and gratitude to all “Tigers” or “Alphas” who sacrificed themselves during “Mountain Storm” , or were killed near the Faculty of Natural Sciences, and who participated in countless actions to protect our security.
The Ministry of the Interior Affairs saw the public call by Branko Crvenkovski for mobilization of all nongovernmental organizations and “independent” intellectuals against the democratically expressed will of the citizens, who for the sixth time in a row gave their support for the option that is offering a better future, according to their reckoning.
We are aware that the lack of ideas and the previous catastrophic results can lead to even greater despair, but this does not give us the right to become part of anyone’s scenarios.
The Ministry of the Interior Affairs will remain open and will continue to work in the service of the citizens.
Within the framework of the devotion for transparency and accountability in its work, as you know, we organized for the first time an open day enabling all citizens to become informed and to provide their suggestions and opinions on the police work.
We thank you for your interest regarding the “Open Day” Project, and all your suggestions and opinions will be taken into serious consideration.

Twitter users used the established hashtag #protestiram ("I protest") to simultaneously link to and comment on the police officials' response.
Irena Cvetkovik wrote :
I protest because a state institution funded by my money also, shamelessly insults and ignores me.
Jovana Tozija also expressed outrage:
I protest because announcements of state institutions are typed in a political party headquarters!!!
Natalija asked this , referring to the traditional concept of life after death:
Where will your soul go, Ministry of the Interior?
Vnukot blogged that the capitalist concept of "the customer is always right" has not penetrated into the Macedonian state institutions:
By analogy, the mistakes have to be admitted and the responsible persons have to answer for them.
By analogy, the citizens, who are the chief consumers of the state, should always be right, when they are right.
Sadly, it seems that the import of these analogies to Macedonia will have to wait for a long time.
Linking to this post, Jovana Tozija added :
True!
The state is always right, not the citizen.
And when the citizen is right, he should apologize for that...

Macedonia: Million Tweets - an Existentialist Parody Poem · Global Voices
Blogger iskra_iskric has dared to adapt a Macedonian rock classic by the band Arhangel to the new digital reality, creating a new poem on tweetering.
Million Tweets (unofficial translation by F.S.)
Do you believe in me?
For I am an illusion that offers
This is someone who follows you
and enjoys tweeting.
Chorus:
Every attempt to follow me
will backfire at you as a retweet,
as a good mentioning.
I am a person who lives from tweeting,
and who's afraid to troll you.
I don't know if there's
Joyful and tireless, I am tweeting dangerously,
for my million followers.
The only reason for me
to go on living,
and there's no way to change me,
all you can do is retweet me.
Do not think about how much I've changed
and that outside I can find everything I need.
Look!
You will see just a mere mortal
eager for tweetup and revolution.
Chorus: Every attempt to follow me....
The parody refers somewhat mildly to the grim atmosphere of the original lyrics by Risto Vrtev, published in 1993 as a song of the album "Arhangel 2."
Million Dollars (unofficial translation by F.S.)
Do you believe in me?
For I am an illusion that offers
all possible shapes.
And I am not me for a long time
This is someone who impersonates me
and enjoys the boredom.
Do not think about how much you've loved
and that love is all you need.
Look!
You will see just a mere mortal
without a concept for revolution.
Every attempt to love me
will backfire at you as punishment,
as a bitter fraud.
I am a person who lives in fear,
who's afraid to touch you.
I don't know if there's
any love left in me,
or everything disappeared through time.
Lonely and tired I am desperately
seeking my million dollars,
the only reason for me
to go on living.
And there's no way to change me
all you can do is kill me.
North Korea: Did Gaddafi's Execution Scare Kim Jong-il? · Global Voices
Joo Sung-ha is a North Korean defector-turned-journalist who runs a blog named North Korea RT (Real Talk) .
Mr. Joo was born in North Korea and graduated from Kim Il-sung University, one of top prestigious universities in North Korea.
He defected from the country in 1998 and four years later obtained South Korean citizenship.
He regularly publishes long detailed posts about his North Korean experience to give a true insight into the hermit kingdom.
This post is his critique of numerous news reports suggesting that Kim Jong-il, North Korea's dictator, was scared to hear of former Libyan leader, Colonel Gaddafi's, fall.
Beside both being amongst the world's most notoriously brutal dictators, they shared lots of similar traits and it is widely believed that they were friends.

The Global Voices community demands justice for seven free expression advocates who are facing trial in Morocco due to their advocacy.
The seven advocates have sought to defend human rights, hold authorities accountable to the public, and uphold rule of law in their country.
Five have been charged with "threatening the internal security of the State" and two face charges of "receiving foreign funding without notifying the General Secretariat of the government."
We call on the Moroccan government to stand by its commitments to international human rights agreements and drop all charges against these seven individuals.

Among those charged is Hisham Almiraat, a medical doctor and long-time member of our community.
We cannot remain silent in the face of this threat to our friend.
Hisham has had a leading voice in Morocco’s blogosphere for nearly a decade.
He co-founded citizen media projects Talk Morocco and Mamfakinch, and served as Global Voices’ advocacy director.
Balancing profession and passion, Hisham has spent many years working to improve the lives and well-being of Moroccans, both as a civil society advocate and as a medical doctor.

Macedonia: Skopje Zoo Improvements · Global Voices
Blogger Alek Careca posted a small photo gallery from the Skopje Zoo with this comment:
The Skopje Zoo drastically changed its appearance this year, to a great satisfaction of the population from all over Macedonia, but also inciting regular flow of visitors from Kosovo and Serbia.
Renovation of the Zoo was real news to most citizens of Skopje, who generally avoided this decrepit public space in the last few decades for the sake of their own mental health.
Widely considered a place where animals suffer torture due to unbearable conditions, the Zoo only appeared in the media after horrendous incidents such as hippo biting off a limb of a visitor in self-defense, killing of a few deer by burglars, аnd frequent animal deaths or injuries due to firecrackers, stones, plastic bags thrown by human beings...

As documented in this article from 2002, completely contrary to their roaming nature, large carnivores were kept numb in small concrete cells - "lying all day, breaking the habit only to pace nervously from time to time in great speed in front of the iron bars."
Lions in Skopje Zoo, August 2002.
Photo: Filip Stojanovski.
As such, the Skopje Zoo received a lot of bad press over the years, and became world infamous around 2007 when some foreigners took notice of Koko the chimpanzee, and tried to help him.
Orphaned in infancy, Koko suffered from severe depression for years.
His sad face was also used to illustrate the plight of chimps elsewhere (e.g., a Reuters article about the United States).
As a way out of continuous public embarrassment (mostly perpetrated by Vest daily), the authorities allowed Koko's transfer to AAP primate sanctuary in Holland in 2009.
In fact, around that time the Skopje Zoo started re-establishing relations with relevant European associations such as EAZA, which led to the start of renovations and refurbishing, driven by donors and exchange partners.
Reforms intensified in 2010, after the appointment of Dane Kuzmanovski as manager.
The Zoo now seems to have more staff, and outsources a private security agency.
Visitors who want to feed the animals can purchase animal-friendly produce.
A cafe and a pony riding rink have been operational since this past summer.
Most of the cages have been renovated, or new habitats built, and dozens of new animals have been imported, including tigers.
Sponsored events for kids take place in the Zoo, and space for birthday celebrations can be rented.
Cooperation with educational institutions, environmental NGOs and the media has been established.
An example of the latter is the show "Zoo Story," produced by the bilingual (Albanian-Macedonian) Alsat-M TV.
The Skopje Zoo's Facebook page has over 34,000 fans, frequent updates and a responsive administrator capable of admitting mistakes.
Strangely enough, the template of the Zoo's official website has not been updated, and its home page greets its visitors with a stock photo made elsewhere.
As with other public enterprises, critics may also grumble about alleged partisan leanings of business sector partnerships and the HR policy.
Some bad things have happened due to circumstances outside of the staff's control, such as the heatwave deaths of two deer and two gnus transported from Zagreb Zoo in August.
Both zoos announced they would sue the transport company for not allowing a vet to accompany the animals on the 610 km trip.
However, the opposition, which often considers governmental endeavors a facade for money laundering, has been largely silent about the obviously significant investments of public money in the Skopje Zoo.
Possibly because the benefits are tangible and verifiable: most of the animals now live in decent-looking enclosures where they can touch ground and plants, with access to open sky.
Visitors indeed get more gratifying experiences and spread the word. Part of the new lions' enclosure in the Skopje Zoo, introduced in 2010.

Carolin Weinkopf, a German visitor to the Zoo wrote this July:
There various horror stories online about the zoo in Skopje – and we are not zoo-experts, but we couldn’t really understand why.
They might have cleaned it and put bigger cages when they heard the Germans are coming… but for us it looked not much different than the zoo in Berlin, really.
Zoos are probably never the best thing on earth – anyway – here, almost every species was blessed with a bunch of babies, which must be a good sign, or not?
...
Update on Koko: a year ago (Dec. 23, 2009), Vest reported that "the Dutch refuse to let Koko return" because of the miserable conditions.
The latest news (Nov. 6, 2010) is that private companies will build a new dwelling for the 14-year-old ape, who is expected back in April 2011.
Lebanon: CBC Report on Hariri Assassination Sparks Debate · Global Voices
An in-depth CBC report on the high-profile assassination of former Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri has sparked intense discussion in the Lebanese blogosphere.
Tension has resurfaced in Lebanon in recent months as rumours suggest that the UN's Special Lebanon Tribunal is close to indicting Hezballah members in the Hariri assassination.
Hezballah's leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, has vehemently denied any involvement in the killing, and warned of the instability the country will face should the UN indict his operatives.
It is in this tense climate that Canada's CBC publishes a detailed investigation into the Hariri assassination, adding to rumours that Hezballah did in fact carry out the assassination.
The Lebanese blogosphere has been quick to respond.
Discussion has been ongoing on Qifa Nabki's blog, with questions raised and answered by the CBC journalist behind the report - Neil Macdonald.
The question:
The second critique comes from an eagle-eyed friend and long-time reader of this blog, Ben Ryan, who sent me this commentary (which I post with his permission).
CBC, November 19, 2010: “UN commission in Lebanon did no telecom analysis at all for most of its first three years of existence.
At that point, in October of 2007, things began moving fast… in December, a specialist from FTS began examining what the computer was spitting out. … He had identified a small network of mobile phones, eight in all, that had been shadowing Hariri in the weeks prior to his death. … when the investigators began their due diligence, double-checking their work, there was another revelation, this one even more earth-shattering.
Someone digging though the commission’s records turned up a report from a mid-ranking Lebanese policeman that had been sent over to the UN offices nearly a year and a half earlier, in the first months of 2006. …”
This tracks with the previous stories and appears to explain why all this is finally coming out now, and possibly why leaks of it surfaced back in 2006.
But it doesn’t explain the 2005 report, and it doesn’t explain why the 2006 report claimed that the Brammertz investigation was handling the phone records.
These points are important because 1) the phone records were on the radar as of October 2005, and rather than getting shoved in some drawer and forgotten they were being reported on in the international media.
And 2) they were reportedly a key part of the Brammertz-era investigation too, if Le Figaro is accurate (and again, they were being reported in the international media so were hardly gathering dust in a filing cabinet somewhere).
The timeline for these records as laid out in the CBC report just doesn’t make sense.
Also, I find it very convenient that so much of the plot in this story is being driven by one super-human mathematical genius dead man who can neither confirm nor deny any of it.
What’s more, someone at the UN seems to rediscover these phone records and leak them to the international press every time the suspect du jour needs a public relations wupping.
They got buried in the scandal of the 2005 UN report actually (accidentally..) naming names and pointing at Syria, but the timing of the 2006 report, right after the “Divine Victory,” and the 2009 report right before the elections, and now this one as things appear to be ratcheting towards a confrontation, both target Hezbollah.
I’ve seen no attempt at an explanation of how these magical phone records could point to the Syrians in October 2005 and then Hezbollah in 2006, 2009, and 2010.
Basically, I smell a rat.
Maybe these are real and maybe they say exactly what MacDonald says they do.
But this story is being peddled, not investigated.
An investigative reporter capable of discovering all this would also be capable of the 15 minutes of Googling and Google Translating that I did to compile these discrepancies, and either explain them in the new report or at least start asking these questions.
The reply from Neil Macdonald:
I wrote to Neil Macdonald (author of theCBC report about the UN investigation into Rafiq al-Hariri’s murder) asking him if he would respond to some of the questions published on this blog earlier today about the timeline presented in his account of the investigation’s proceedings.
Mr. Macdonald had argued in his piece that “Brammertz could not be persuaded to authorize the one technique that those investigators wanted above all to deploy: telecommunications analysis,” and that “the UN commission in Lebanon did no telecom analysis at all for most of its first three years of existence.”
As some of our fearless readers have pointed out, the Mehlis report itself clearly indicates that the Commission was using telecoms data in its investigation to track Hariri’s killers.
So why, I asked Mr. Macdonald, would Brammertz have had to authorize telecommunications analysis if the Commission was already using it in 2005?
Or was that earlier work done under Mehlis a different kind of telecoms analysis from the stuff performed by Wissam Eid?
Mr. Macdonald responded to my query with the following note, which I quote with permission: “The question we addressed in the documentary was when the commission began carrying out actual telecomms analysis of phone records.
My sources — and they were there — are absolutely firm.
The commission did none until late 2007.The Lebanese police did.
Capt. Eid was the first to discover the red network, and the first to identify the co-location phones.
The commission under Mehlis was aware of the ISF’s early telecomms work.
Brammertz referred to the commission’s collection of phone records (I refer to that in my piece; they obtained the entire 2005 phone database for Lebanon).
But actual telecomms analysis by the commission itself, as I reported, was not authorized until late 2007, at which time FTS, the British firm, was brought in."
Perhaps the most contentious part of the CBC report is the alleged duplicitous behaviour of Lebanon's intelligence chief, Col. Wissam Hassan.
The apparent linkage between Hariri's top intelligence officer and Hezballah is difficult to grasp, according to two Lebanese bloggers, Beirut Spring and the Angry Arab.
Beirut Spring:
If you thought that the CBC report was a slam dunk by the Hariri alliance against Hezbollah, I’m afraid you got the wrong idea.
There’s a part of the report that casts doubt on the role of Colonnel Wissam El Hassan in the crime.
Col. Hassan is firmly in the Hariri camp and the fact that his name was brought up by the CBC report as a suspect has caused dissonance in many minds.
Col. Hassan remains one of those targeted by Hezbollah as a “false witnesse”, so what gives?
According to the CBC, col. Hassan was supposed to be in the Hariri convoy the day he was killed, but he didn’t show up and gave what the CBC calls “flimsy” alibis.
He also supposedly lied about a phone call he made before the crime.
The fact that Col. Hassan’s name came out makes the picture muddier and will cause great confusion.
Angry Arab:
This CBC report rendered a great service to Hizbullah's campaign against the Hariri court.
Public opinion surveys in Lebanon already point to a clear and systematic decline in public support for the court, even among Sunnis and Druzes (the Christians are split).
I mean, to accuse the key intelligence guy in the Hariri camp, Al-Hasan, of complicity is to turn the investigation into a farce.
This Wisam Hasan was so key to UN investigation that he was even used (at least in the case of "false witness", Muhammad Zuhayr As-Siddiq) as the official interpretor of the UN team.
And for the report to rely on the account of Mehlis discredited the court and report further.
The Hariri camp is now clearly at war, and Wisam Hasan (who is named in the report) has so much dirt on his Hariri enemies and will fight back.
The movie will now get more interesting and suspenseful.
As for the Hariri investigation itself, you may relegate it to late night TV, on "Nick at Night".
Check your local listing.
The Human Province believes the investigation has become a question of competing conspiracy theories:
The discussion about Hariri’s assassination quickly becomes a question of competing conspiracy theories, and necessarily so, because there was clearly a conspiracy to assassinate Hariri.
The question is: a conspiracy by whom?
And that’s what is so frustrating to me: without any hard evidence, be it presented by the STL or Hassan Nasrallah, we are left to the mercy of conjecture.
(Incidentally, the STL isn’t the only international court that’s facing problems of legitimacy and false witnesses.)
And worse, given that we are in the realm of conspiracy and competing theories thereof, we are forced into an epistemological Chinese finger trap in which evidence against a theory actually becomes evidence in favor of it.
This is convenient for partisans, since there isn’t much that can challenge the particular conspiracy theory carried out by the villains their ideological and political worldview suggest.
But unfortunately for the rest of us, we’re left with the uncomfortable choice between exhaustion bordering on apathy on the one hand, or vulgarity and naïveté on the other.

Philippines: Former President Arrested · Global Voices
Dramatic attempts by former Philippine President and current congresswoman Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo to escape the country have sparked public outrage on Twitter and other social networking sites.
Arroyo and her husband Jose Miguel Arroyo have attempted to leave the country several times these past few days, claiming she was only seeking medical treatment abroad.
These attempts were blocked, reportedly because the Arroyos were under investigation for plunder, human rights violations, and electoral fraud controversies under her term as president.
Arroyo was president from 2001 to 2010.
The Noynoy Aquino government's failure to prosecute Arroyo even after more than 500 days in office has been blamed for the former president's almost successful attempts to flee the country.
A warrant of arrest for "electoral sabotage" has been issued against Arroyo after the Philippine Supreme Court has ruled that she must be allowed to travel overseas because no charges have been filed against her.
Here are some of the reactions on Twitter:
@teddycasino: It is with utmost joy that we welcome the issuance of a warrant of arrest against GMA.
Since 2005 we have been trying to make her account for her cheating, stealing and lying ways.
This is a vindication of our efforts.
But the work has just begun.
There is the difficult legal battle ahead and more cases that have to be filed in court.
We laud the COMELEC, DOJ and Pasay RTC for their swift and decisive action. (author's note: Comelec is election agency, DOJ is Department of Justice)
@hgcastillo: I wonder what GMA is feeling right now... @KikoHubilla: GMA is trying to leave the country to avoid all the accusations against her.
@gibbscadiz: the outcome was good-arroyo charged-but the getting there was as ad hoc, incompetent, amateurish as it could get; nothing to be proud of. @NielZapanta: Whenever there's a flash news about #arroyoarrest, it looks like a teleserye.
@NielZapanta: Whenever there's a flash news about #arroyoarrest, it looks like a soap opera. Watch out for the next episode... @w3ncy: #itlognitopacio saved by this afternoon's developments on the CGMA arrest.
@carloshconde: Today was not political will in action.
It was desperation, w/ govt fully aware that there would be hell to pay if Arroyo managed to leave.
The hashtag #ArroyoArrest has been trending on Twitter worldwide after Arroyo's arrest warrant has been served Friday evening.
The hashtag #itlognitopacio also trended after the Arroyos' legal counsel Ferdinand Topacio wagered that he will have one of his testicles removed if the Arroyos do not return from overseas. Thumbnail used is from Twitpic page of @HecklerForever.
United States: “Occupy Wall Street” Gets Stronger · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage #Occupy Worldwide.
When we published our first story on "Occupy Wall Street," about a group that was camping out on Zuccotti Park, it barely made the front pages of local newspapers.
Currently, with hundreds of thousands of followers that have joined the cause — including union leaders, intellectuals like Slavoj Zizek, and other personalities such as Michael Moore — Occupy Wall Street has captured the attention of the national and internationl media, and the protests have extended to many other cities in the United States, including Boston, Hartford, Seattle, Washington D.C., and Tampa (for a complete coverage please check the Occupy Together website).
This movement has generated so much attention that it even came to be a topic for discussion amongst politicians and media professionals, including Eric Alterman of the Center for American Progress, who understands the movement's "impatience and anger," and supports what Nobel Prize for Economics winner Joseph Stiglitz once considered "the Era of the 1%," alluding to the 1% that holds the majority of the wealth in the United States.
Hundreds of thousands of protestors have gathered in the surrounding areas of Wall Street.

Nonetheless, others do not share this opinion: Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain, has launched criticisms against Occupy Wall Street, claiming that the economic crisis does not stem from Wall Street but rather the White House, and maintains that the demonstrators should blame themselves for not being millionaires and not having a job (an argumentin line with the Republican and Neoliberal ideologies.)
As expected, his comments have awoken strong criticisms upon classifying it as an "irrational ideology."
Bloggers like Robert W. Snyder from nj.com believe that the story of the protest deserves a better angle, since the press has focused more on the confrontations between protestors and the police.
As we saw in the sixties, a peaceful protest was defined by disproportionate coverage of a trouble-seeking minority of protesters.
As is so often the case, it was the photos and headlines that were most misleading.
Photographs are great for capturing action and anger, but they just can't carry the nuances best conveyed by words.
The Spectacle Blog's Joseph Lawler clarifies the difference between Occupy Wall Street and the ultraconservative Tea Party Movement, since some speculate that the former may become a political group.
Judging by photos of Occupy Wall Street activists, the movement, for now at least, appears to be closer to the "rebellious youth" model of protest than the "fed-up citizenry" feel of the Tea Party.
We'll see where it goes from here.
Experts confirm that President Barack Obama has attempted to channel the anger and growing strength that Occupy Wall Street has built up to justify his bill on job creation.
Justin Vassallo from The Faster Times, however, believes that Occupy Wall Street has not validated the President's image in order to continue carrying out his mission:
If Obama truly has been following the Occupy Wall Street movement, he must realize a passionate and growing coalition of the American people are already mobilizing without him.
Particularly on Twitter, some have expressed their opinion with respect to Occupy Wall Street's possible political motives, such as Unedited Camera(@Uneditedcamera):
#occupywallstreet this movement is not about political parties.
It’s about democratizing our lives.
Chris Spencer (@Chris_M_Spencer), on the other hand, has criticized the movement in the following way:
Definition of a crybaby: being mad at corporations because you're unemployed. @OccupyWallSt #OccupyWallStreet #OWS #futility
Similarly, curmudgeon (@Curmudgeonisto) believes that the movement is wasting its time:
#OccupyWallstreet protesters would be less "poor" if they put half their wasted effort into pursuit of Education/Training/Jobs #OWS #TCOT
OccupyWallStreetNYC (@OccupyWallStNYC) responded to the force used by local authorities:
The best response to their violence is more peace. #occupywallstreet #sep17
Jordan Hammond (@InktViek) describes Occupy Wall Street's fight with a quote from Gandhi:
#occupywallstreet "first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win" –Ghandi , they are now fighting us

Video: A Day in the Life of a Blind Person · Global Voices
Braille by Ralph Aichinger CCBy
In his latest video, he shows us how he crosses busy streets: in one case, there's an audible signal that lets him know when it is safe to cross, and in the other case, he has to figure out traffic patterns through sound, and then attempt to cross in what he describes as a scary experience:
Mr. Edison is also a film critic.
He focuses on the characters, dialogues, music and storytelling, and through his telling, he gives us a new perspective on how a blind person perceives such a visual medium.
In this video review, there are parts where the screen goes black while the audio continues which really helps the viewer understand how movies play out for the blind.
This next video is his spoiler free review of X-Men: First Class.
Tommy Edison usually goes to the movie theater for the films he reviews, but he also watches DVDs at home.
However, setting up a DVD player that was sold to him as accessible proves to be a bit more complicated than he thought.
Although the DVD player instructions come in a multiplicity of languages, they don't include Braille so learning to use his new equipment is more than a bit challenging.
This next video shows how, even though technology gets adapted for people with disabilities, efforts fall short of the mark as in the next example of ATM use.
If just the technology aspect weren't hard enough, Tommy also has to deal with people's perceptions, as they lose patience because he takes longer to get his money from an automated teller machine designed for people who can see:
And once Tommy has the money in his hand?
Things don't get any easier since using paper money requires a whole lot of organization and trust so that people actually give him the right amount of change since in the US, there is no way for the blind to tell bills apart:
Egypt: The Revolution is Back! · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Egypt Revolution 2011.
Up to 100,000 people are said to be in Tahrir Square now, as police and the army continue to battle with protesters calling for an end to Egypt's military rule.
Protesters have had running battles with the armed gunmen working serving the Egyptian government since Friday and are now adamant to stay in the square until their demands are met.
So far, reports say that 35 people have died in the clashes.
Among the chief demands is calling for a civil government, to take the place of the Supreme Council for Armed Forces (SCAF), the military establishment which has installed itself as the defacto ruler of Egypt after former President Hosni Mubarak was toppled in February.
NBC's reporter Richard Engel tweets:
@richardengelnbc: #egypt.
Perhaps 100 k now in #Tahrir.

Spain: Controversies in the General Elections · Global Voices
This post is part of our special coverage Europe in Crisis. The PP (Popular Party) of Spain won the recent elections with an ample majority.
After 100% of the ballots were counted, the neoliberal party claimed the victory.
The attendees of the celebration at Génova Street in Madrid (where the PP's general headquarter is located) gave a taste of what's to be expected from now on in Spain: social cuts and employment cuts, in order to make their constituents and the markets happy.
Let's not forget that the number of abstentions and blank votes reached 10,000,000 to thus become the second political force in the country, even though this is not reflected in the results or the mainstream media.
Pakistan: The Desperation Cards · Global Voices
The Governor of Punjab Salmaan Taseer distributes Watan cards to flood victims.

The story of mismanagement of the donations collected for flood relief in Pakistan has been widely reported.
Not only that, the methods of distribution of reliefs and utilizing those funds for other purposes have also been questioned.
One such controversial campaign is the "Watan Cards" (literally National Cards or Country Cards) program, under which VISA powered electronic debit cards are to be issued and distributed among the flood victims.
The solution may sound very simple, but there are a lot of complications and difficulties involved.
Not just the usability, the issuance of the cards has been troublesome too.
Taha Kehar at Pak Tea House writes:
In the month of October, there have been various controversies surrounding the issuance of Watan Cards.
It has become exceedingly difficult to acquire a Watan Card.
Mob tendencies have intensified as a result of which the constabularies have been forced to take extreme action.
The events that led to the death of one man when police personnel issued a baton-charge in the Shehr Sultan region of South Punjab, exemplifies the extremities of such a reaction.
And then to worsen the situation, there had been the reports of sale of Watan Cards as Tazeen informs at The Pak Spectator blog:
Sources in Nadra said a careful examination of the ATM transaction through Watan Cards showed that in several cases, cash was withdrawn from ATM machines in big cities which were far away from the districts of persons to whom the cards were issued.
The sources said a large number of Watan Cards were sold and the government had started a high-level probe into the matter.
There were reports that many people sold their Watan Cards for Rs 25,000 to Rs 30,000 in Rahimyar Khan, Muzaffargarh, Jacobabad and other interior Sindh districts.
Also, there have been reports and buzz in the social media about the provincial governments blocking the Watan Cards to use for their own purpose.
Marvi Sirmed, a writer, urges for a proper investigation:
I invite some of the holy anchors/reporters to investigate why Punjab MNAs are trying to block Watan Cards, like they did with BISP forms?
It seems that most of the projects that have been initiated for the flood victims are somehow benefiting the stakeholders involved.
If we even consider that issuing VISA powered, ATM enabled Watan cards to the flood affected people, who hardly have access to ATM machines, is a good idea, we have to admit that its management was disastrous.
The worse thing is that the desperation among the flood victims is so huge that it's making them do just anything for the food and relief goods.
Macedonia: Satirical Blog Blames Name Dispute for Greek Bankruptcy · Global Voices
Sead93, a renowned Macedonian blogger and one of the country's most influential Twitter users, has published a satirical article which, in a way, sums up many of the local jokes about the Greek financial problems and the political situation in Macedonia.
Parodying the sensationalist style and clichés overused by the local media, he wrote about a "scandalous" revelation:
High diplomatic sources confirmed for the "Copy Paste" news portal and the "Google Translate" press agency that high political functionaries from Macedonia are behind the bankruptcy of our Southern Neighbor.
According to these sources, who, understandably, asked to remain anonymous, the last phases of the plan to bankrupt Greece, crafted and carefully implemented by Skopje, are underway. Unlike other political actions, this has been done in coordination with the opposition.
The chief "ringleader" and conspirator of this plan is the first Macedonian president .
He has held a grudge with Greece since the 1990s due to the economic embargo, but he has especially bad blood with the family, i.e. with Andreas Papandreou, the father of the recent Greek Prime Minister, George Papandreou.
The plan was to suck up Greece to spend extraordinary amounts of funds in the name dispute and the battles related to this issue.
One of the key strategies were the operative activities of the special unit labeled "Traitors" whose members offered their services to Greek interests for high amounts of money.
The high number of such Macedonian operatives who lead the Greeks to believe they work for them, and the associated expenses, in fact bankrupted Greece, claim informed sources.
They also add that the Skopje 2014 Project was part of this plan. Its purpose was to defocus the attention of the Greek side from the true goals.
While the Greeks thought that the whole resistance and resources of the Macedonian side were being spent on this megalomaniacal project, the plan for gradual Greek bankruptcy was underway.
Greeks incurred additional expenses with various activities related to lobbying against the Macedonian side, starting from the United Nations, to international beauty pageants, to various websites such as livescore.com, which have been paid off to avoid using our constitutional name.
In the conclusion of the article, Sead93 juxtaposed the photos of Savo Klimovski , legal expert and former speaker of the Macedonian Parliament, and Lucas Papademos, economics expert and the current Greek prime minister.
Savo Klimovski and Lucas Papademos.
Collage by Sead93.
The final phase of the plan is appointing "our man" as the head of the Greek Government, who - according to the well-informed sources - would "get the job done."
At this time, there are speculations that this task has been undertaken by Savo Klimovski, former speaker of the Parliament and Skopje Law Faculty professor.
With mild corrections of his face, Klimovski has been "planted" as a "savior" of the Greek economy and state - while he in essence is a key player of the Macedonian side.
After this post was published, scores of social media users applauded it, sharing the link via Facebook and Twitter.
It was listed within the selection of the most impressive blog posts for November on the website Krigla Pivo , which, its authors think, shows the renewal and improving quality of the Macedonian blogosphere "after a longer period of abstinence and stagnation."
However, not everybody from Macedonia was able or willing to appreciate the irony and the humor of the post, or the mentions of the excesses of the regime, according to the prevalent logic "if absolute praise is absent, then it must be an opponent."
Some comments in the post descend to ad hominem attacks.
The government's favorite pundit Milenko Nedelkovski, a perpetrator of the Brussels incident, infamous for public use of hate speech with impunity (including demands to "liquidate" "the traitors" from lists he drafts in his TV show), posted the link on his Facebook page with a comment suggesting the post is a part of some anti-Macedonian conspiracy.
Nedelkovski is thought to be part of an inner circle of several media personages close to the leadership of the country who serve as their mouthpieces or testers of ideas.
His closeness is demonstrated by the fact that he accompanied the Prime Minister (a frequent guest star of his TV show) on state visits to Singapore and Japan.
When that news became public , the government issued a retraction , claiming that "the journalist... covers the visits at his own expense."
Saudi Arabia: Free Saudi Scholar Dr Mohammed Alabdulkareem · Global Voices
Dr Mohammed Alabdulkareem.
Image from his Facebook fan page
Saudi Dr Mohammed Alabdulkareem was arrested after publishing an article on the effectiveness of the political regulation among the royal family .
The scholar holds a PhD degree in Islamic Regulations, and teaches at Al-Imam Muhammed ibn Saud Islamic University.
And the article was not his first, as he had written several others discussing political issues within the Saudi community.
The Arrest
According to Dr Alabdulkareem's Facebook fan page, he had expressed his expectations to be arrested to his friend Abdullah Almalki, after publishing the article and prior to his arrest.
Reporters Without Borders notes that Dr Alabdulkareem was arrested at his home by four men with no warrant on December 5, 12 days after posting the article.
Free Dr Alabdulkareem
As a reaction to the arrest, social media was filled with calls to release the scholar.
Two fan pages was created in response to the arrest on Facebook.
They are: "Free Dr.Alabdulkarim" and "We are all Mohammed Abdulkarim."
Moreover, on Twitter the hashtag #FreeDrAbdulkarim was used to call for his release.
Many blog entries were also written with calls for his release.
Below are some of the reactions.
The blogger Talaf poses questions about his country: فهل علمتم عن بلد ما قرر عقاب أحد من أبنائه لمجرد أنه ينادي بوجوب حمايته والحفاظ عليه !! Have you ever heard of a country that punishes one of its own sons just because he asked to protect and preserve that country!!!!
From Twitter, Abdulrahman Alnasri, is willing to be arrested for standing up for his country too: رسالة للذين اعتقلوا الدكتور العبدالكريم: أنا وكثيرين غيري نؤمن بكب كلمة قالها الدكتور في مقاله، فهل ستعتقلوننا أيضا؟ #FreeDrAbdulkarim To those who arrested Dr. Alabdulkareem: I, and many others, believe in every word Dr. Al-Abdulkarim said in his article.
Are you going to arrest us too?
From the scholar's fan page, Khaled Alhojoori comments: لم لا يسجنون يده التي كتبت ؟ لم لا يسجنون القلم الذي خط؟
لقد أصبحت حياة الناس تبعا لأمزجة البعض ،، تضيع سنوات من عمرك لا بأس بذلك ،، فهي ليست ملكا لك ،، هي ملك لغيرك
كان الله في عونك أخونا محمد ,, فنحن لا نملك غير الكلام ، وأخشى أن يصادر Why don't they arrest his hand or his pen for writing?
Why do they give them a small margin of freedom, and then take this margin away?
Many lives now depend on the moods of some.
It is fine to waste years of your life, because it isn't yours, it belongs to others.
May Allah be with you brother Mohammed.
We have nothing to offer but our words, and we are afraid that even this may be taken away.
Finally, Nofah wondered about Dr. Alabulkareem's fate, and whether he will spend the rest of his life in jail, like many other political prisoners: أخشى ما أخشاه أن يصبح الدكتور كمن سبقه من أصحابه الأحرار وأن يمكث في السجن سنين عديدة دون تهمة أو جريرة، تهمته فقط قول الحق من غير مراء My worst fear is that Dr Alabdulakreem becomes like his predecessors who stayed in prison for many years without charge or fault.
Their only charge was telling the truth without doubt.
Talking About Hurricane Sandy on Social Networks · Global Voices
After slamming the Caribbean, Hurricane Sandy came to the east coast of the United States on October 29, bringing rainfall and even snowfall in its path.
The eye of the hurricane landed in southwest New Jersey, 10 kilometers from Atlantic City.
Millions of dollars in property damage were reported, in addition to unofficial reports of 62 deaths and millions of residents without electricity in various states throughout the country, including Washington D.C.
Sandy has also paralyzed the entire city of New York.
Its subway service, one of the most extensive in the world, has been suspended since the evening of October 28 and it is presumed to take approximately four to five more days to restore its function fully, while buses are the only transit system that is gradually getting back to regular service.
Likewise, LaGuardia, John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty airports are expected to resume air traffic control by the end of this week, while ferry services that connect to other towns in New Jersey and Connecticut have been cancelled and the Holland and Lincoln tunnels that connect New York to New Jersey remain flooded.
Events like the Halloween Parade and the New York Marathon on November 4 will possibly be postponed until next week.
The Stock Exchange, whose operations closed for the first time since the attack on September 11, 2001, re-opened on Wednesday, October 31.
Despite the fact that the presidential candidates have promised to focus on recovery efforts, the "superstorm" has not escaped the political scene.
Editorials in some of the most important newspapers in the country accuse former governor and Republican candidate Mitt Romney of wanting to cut funds to FEMA, the agency responsible for responding to natural disasters, once he takes presidential office.
Nevertheless, Romney denied these accusations and affirmed that rescue teams should receive more funding from the state.
In a sign of bipartisanship, Republic governor of New Jersey Chris Christie and President Barack Obama applauded each other's immediate response to the catastrophe caused by the hurricane.
As expected, Sandy became a trending topic on Twitter and users like Raúl Avila Durán (@Raulavilad) took note of it:
@Raulavilad: Hurricane #Sandy continues to be the most read story.
Here are the most shocking videos of the storm http://w.abc.es/jkqit4

Malaysia: Moratorium on Medical Schools · Global Voices
The Malaysian government has imposed a five-year moratorium on medical programs across the country, with the aim of shifting the focus from quantity to quality as the number of medical graduates increase every year.
Pagalavan Letchumanan believes that imposing a moratorium alone will not be enough.
The current existing schools are just too many and they will keep increasing the number of students to make more money.
Thus the number of graduates will continue to rise...
I think it is important, especially for parents that medicine is not a guaranteed life anymore in the next 2-3 years time.
I really hope parents and students will stop thinking about glorified life by doing medicine.
Pilocarpine shares the same sentiments.
Reading through them, I could not help but to point out how inappropriate for the Paper to stressed the low quality of grads from Russia, Ukraine, Indonesia or India, because through my little years with these junior doctors, I had seen more than a handful of house officers graduated from those countries having more knowledge, initiative and participation than those from local unis.
If those oversea medical schools were substandard from the beginning, how do they pass recognition from our esteemed board of higher learning?
Medicine Malaysia also believes that the moratorium is inadequate, and there needs to be a reform in the medical schools to increase the quality of graduates.
The accreditation process of medical schools needs to be stringent and a high benchmark should be set.
Attracting academicians to our shores and keeping existing ones should have similar priorities.
This is what we want to hear from the Honourable Health Minister.
A 5 year moratorium is a knee jerk reflex to a problem which clearly needs more addressing.
Alex Tang however, is relieved that the problem of an oversupply of medical students has been acknowledged, although he feels that it is too late.
The 24 medical schools are already churning out graduates while there are many other students in overseas medical schools who will be graduating and coming home soon.
The impending oversupply of doctors in Malaysia is going to be a reality soon.
Yet I see parents everywhere in Malaysia urging their children to study medicine.
It is clear that this issue is not being met with support by most Malaysians, and many had even blamed the government for creating the problem in the first place.
Blogger Dr Hsu expressed one such opinion.
The sudden mushrooming of medical schools are apparently due to shortages of doctors in the public sectors.
This is because most doctors in government service resign after their compulsory services and opt for the supposedly greener pasture in the private sector.
In most other countries, the logical thing to do to counter this brain drain of doctors to private sector is to find out why doctors are resigning from government service and then try to address the woes of the doctors , and hopefully keep them in service.
I call this common logic.
The Malaysian solution , like in many other instances, does not take common logic into account but rather uses the sledgehammer approach.
If the doctors do not want to stay in government service, then Malaysia shall flood the market with doctors, so goes the Malaysian logic.
Never mind that setting up of medical schools and training doctors are expensive businesses.
If enough doctors are produced, the market will be saturated with doctors and thus doctors will have no where to go but to stay put in government service.
These come in light of the report in Malaysia's leading English newspaper The Star of the Government's decision to impose a five-year moratorium on medical schools.

Fears for Hong Kong's Press Freedom Follow Alibaba's Purchase of the South China Morning Post · Global Voices
Image from Hong Kong Free Press.
This post was written by Vivienne Zeng and originally published on Hong Kong Free Press on December 14, 2015.
The edited version below is republished on Global Voices under a partnership agreement.
Chinese Internet giant Alibaba will buy Hong Kong’s largest English-language newspaper, the South China Morning Post, and other media assets belonging to the SCMP Group for HK$2.06 billion (about US$265 million), the Group said in a filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange on 14 December.
The deal, which was confirmed on Friday following weeks of speculation, has drawn concerns about press freedom in the city.
Co-founded by Tse Tsan-tai, one of the earliest Chinese revolutionaries of the late Qing Dynasty, and veteran journalist Alfred Cunningham, the South China Morning Post was first published in 1903.
Tse turned the paper into a platform for advocating reform and a "printing house for the Chinese revolution".
Its revolutionary nature has eroded overtime, in particular after it was privatised by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation in 1987 and sold to Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok in 1993.
In recent years, the paper was criticized for its pro-Beijing editorial stance and accused of self-censoring political news.
Many predict the shift of ownership to Alibaba will transform the paper into another mouthpiece of the mainland Chinese government.
The Hong Kong Journalists’ Association issued a statement saying it worried that the ownership change would mean the paper would make even more compromises on China coverage.
The association was especially concerned about comments made by Alibaba Executive Vice Chairman Joseph Tsai, who said he hoped the South China Morning Post could provide an angle different from mainstream Western media in reporting China.
Meanwhile, Chinese netizens lamented that the deal could mean “death” for the century-old newspaper.
Some users on the popular social media platform Weibo lit candles for the South China Morning Post, while others said the newspaper would become “government media.”
Good deal or bad deal?
The SCMP-Alibaba deal was one of the hottest topics over the weekend after the South China Morning Post published the news on its website on the night of December 11, followed immediately by an Alibaba statement, an in-depth interview with Tsai and Tsai’s letter to readers, in which he vowed to preserve the newspaper’s editorial independence.

While most Western media reports compared the deal with Amazon chief Jeff Bezos’s purchase of the Washington Post, Chinese reports examined the domestic media landscape.
Many noted Alibaba was improving its media portfolio to counter the other two Internet giants in the famous BAT club – Baidu and Tencent.
Both Baidu and Tencent have their own established web news portals and are influential in the entertainment and social media industries.
Coming relatively late to the game, Alibaba has made a wise strategic move by buying an influential English media outlet, which has for decades reported on sensitive topics seen as taboos in China, new media outlet Jiemian said.
Bloomberg noted the purchase was a good deal for Alibaba business-wise too.
The e-commerce company acquired the South China Morning Post for less than twice the media business’s annual revenue last year, while Business Insider was sold to Axel Springer SE for six times its estimated revenue for 2016, Bloomberg said.
In the same report, Peter Schloss, managing partner of CastleHill Partners LLC, a Beijing-based advisory and investment company, noted Jack Ma was “doing the central government a favour by ensuring that the South China Morning Post is in friendly hands.”
However, Tech In Asia said the deal was a big public relations mistake for Ma.
“Alibaba is buying the South China Morning Post to spread a positive narrative about China.
That’s a terrible idea,” editor Charles Custer said, “The problem – and this is the big mistake Alibaba is making – is that now Alibaba becomes the scapegoat for any and every instance of pro-Beijing bias found in the paper.”
"Kosovo 2.0 Talks Sex" Launch Party Cancelled Due to Attack · Global Voices
Kosovo 2.0, a website with interactive blogs, articles and multimedia, published in Albanian, English and Serbian, was planning to launch its new print issue at the "Kosovo 2.0 Talks Sex" event on December 14.
The topics covered in it included LGBT life in Kosovo and the Balkans, dating, sex education, gender reassignment surgeries in Belgrade, and much, much more.
Kosovo 2.0 published a statement on their Facebook page after the incident:
Dear readers and friends of Kosovo 2.0:
After the 6pm incident, special police forces were called to the venue.
At around 10:30, around half an hour before the launch party, a group of over 100 protesters approached the building, yelling epithets such as “Out pederasts!” and “Allah u akber!”
Despite the police presence, we decided to be safe rather than risk the safety of our staff and guests in the building.
We had to be evacuated out by the police in small groups so as not to provoke the crowd.
Our launch event agenda included a screening of two films and various interviews, a discussion with magazine contributors, and a party with music, drinking, and dancing.
Last night’s events reveal more strongly than ever the need for free and critical thought.
They demonstrated how easily endangered basic human rights are in the face of religious extremism, hooliganism and narrow-mindedness.
Kosovo 2.0 achieved its mission in investigating sexuality in Kosovo and across the Balkans in our Sex issue, and we believe it is a milestone of journalism in the region.
We give our heartfelt thanks to our supporters and those who stayed with us until the end of the night.
Rest assured that we will continue to speak out against inequality, hate, and prejudice, wherever and whenever we can.
Syria: Let It Snow! · Global Voices
It's been a whirlwind week of weird weather for much of the Levant, as relieving rains and surprise snows blanket the landscape.
In the Syrian capital, the streets are covered with snow for the first time in years.
Though the Damascus skies occasionally sprinkle snow, rarely does it stick to the ground.
One blogger, 50% Syrian, is thrilled by the development:
For most young Damascenes (20s, early 30s), this is the very first time in their life that they see it snow in Damascus.
A report I just read says it’s been 25 years since it last snowed in this beautiful city of spirit and soul.
But according to my father-in-law he saw it snow around 50 years ago… and doesn’t remember seeing snow on the streets of the Syrian capital, ever since.
Before settling in this city I most cherish and adore, I have been in and out of Damascus during many seasons, but this is the first time in my 30-something life that I see snow fluff down from the sky, so serenely and beautifully, filling me with hope and love, more than anything else.

Why so Syria? describes herself as a Mexican-American in Damascus by way of Boston.
For that reason, she was especially surprised to wake up to snow flurries.
The blogger writes:
Ok so Christmas is still a few days away but this morning we woke up to significant flurries in Damascus.
What an unexpected and pleasant surprise!
As I groggily opened my eyes and looked out the window, for a split second I thought I was still in Boston...
...This city is always full of surprises.
Just when you think you’ve got the place figured out, BAM — SNOW!
It kind of blows my mind.
Photo by blogger Why So Syria?
Syrian blogger Ayman Ashour unfortunately missed the snowfall.
He quips: Those of us who are deprived of the wonders of the cold and the beautiful gift of snow are asking you to send us some photos so we could ease our children's protests and demands of playing with snow as we once did.

Breaking a Four-Century Custom That Denied Women Temple Entry in India · Global Voices
Screenshot from video
Across the history of many world religions, women were considered ritually unclean because of menstruation and the beliefs surrounding it.
This social perception led to women being denied entry into religious sites for centuries.
In India, women are challenging and changing these centuries-old traditions that restrict women's rights.
No women were allowed in the Shani Shingnapur temple in Ahmednagar district of Maharashtra for the past four centuries.
On November 28, 2015, a woman entered the inner sanctum called the “sacred platform” to offer her prayers.
Enraged by this act, the villagers of Shingnapur shut their businesses for a day.
Seven security personnel were sacked, security was tightened with more CCTV cameras, and everyone at the temple was warned to be more vigilant in order to keep women worshippers at bay.
Subsequently activists from Trupti Desai-led Bhumata Mahila Brigade tried to enter the Shingnapur temple but were denied entry.
The matter escalated and reached the Bombay High Court on April 1, which ruled:
Those who prevent women from entering the places of worship should be arrested....they face six months jail under the Act.
On April 8, 2016, the Shani Shingnapur temple lifted its ban on women.
However, there are still many temples in India where such bans continue.
For example, the Maskoba temple in the Veer Village of the Pune District in the Indian state of Maharashtra, was still refusing to let women enter the inner sanctum of the temple after the court order.
Video Volunteers' community correspondent Rohini Pawar decided to do something about it.
Rohini an atheist, and fierce advocate of women’s rights, took up the matter up with the community at first, and then with the temple authorities.
In the video, Rohini asked: "If we all have equal rights and freedom then why such restrictions on women?"
She spoke to the women in the community and realised they have never protested this practice, due to the fear of backlash for violating traditional practices.
With the help of a local NGO, she made a petition to the Maskoba temple authorities.
The temple authority honored the petition and after lengthy discussions allowed women to enter the inner sanctum of the temple.
On April 13, local women broke with tradition and entered the temple.
Along with Hindu Temples like Shani Shingnapur or Sabarimala, entry for women has for years been traditionally prohibited in the Muslim holy place Haji Ali Dargah in Mumbai.
The Supreme Court of India delivered a verdict October 24 after a long court battle that upheld equal access for men and women to the sanctum sanctorum of Haji Ali Dargah.
Only last month a group of women activists were finally able to enter the Dargah.
Great news!
Women should be allowed to enter every single religious institution in India - be it a dargah or a temple. #RightToPray https://t.co/LCptZm2Ttk — Amena (@Fashionopolis) October 24, 2016
India Today: After Haji Ali opened doors to women, Padmanabhaswamy temple relaxes dress code. https://t.co/c9KAwyqB6v — Deepmala (@DeepmalaCrystal) December 17, 2016
These judicial rulings have provided the legal grounds for a pushback against gender discrimination at holy sites while women activists live Rohini continue to drive change on the ground.
However, as this tweet demonstrates, there is still a long way to go.

Syria's War May be the Most Documented Ever—And Yet We Know So Little. · Global Voices
Syria liveuamap of Aleppo depicting verified events on December 7, 2016, as Aleppo was falling.
Liveuamap is an "opendata-driven media platform" that tracks events in conflict by time, location and type. http://syria.liveuamap.com/en/time/07.12.2016
Listen to this story on PRI.org »
We follow the tweets of 7-year-old Bana Alabed and her mother; the last messages of activists and fighters waiting to surrender or die; and seek to verify chemical attacks or conflicting stories about the bombings of hospitals.
And at the same time, we struggle to understand whether this information fits into our existing worldviews, or upends them.
The Syrian civil war may be the most documented war in history.
Millions of images, videos, blogs, tweets and audio files have been created about the war, the life that continues on in Syria despite the war, and the affiliated refugee crisis.
These media — created by journalists, citizens, activists, combatants and victims — are the product of our burgeoning participatory media culture, of the overlay of digital documentation and reflection that accompanies much of modern life.
Syria, prior to the war, had reasonably robust and growing communications technology, with access to mass media networks, satellite TV, internet and mobile data.
Access to those technologies gave Syrians the tools both to communicate among themselves and to connect with the rest of the world.
Enough remnants of those networks exist now to allow people in conflict zones to continue sharing information.
Despite the war (or perhaps because of it), Syrian citizen media networks, with increasing knowledge and skill, have been a major conduit for the documentation of the war.
But access to huge online archives of information about the war doesn’t guarantee that it is organized or presented in ways that accord with our expectations of war reporting.
That’s because information in modern conflict isn’t simply about impartially reporting the facts as they occur.
Information instead is part of the battle for perception about the war and its combatants.
That, in turn, forms opinions about who is just and moral, who is worth supporting politically or with resources, and who will be a target of attack.
Information and its manipulation have been a vital strategic element in this conflict, and the control of information has become a weapon.
The Syrian Electronic Army, a parastatal force supporting the Assad regime, in the early days of the struggle targeted activists with "distributed denial-of-service" (DDoS) attacks, hacks and malware.
Meanwhile, both the Assad regime and ISIS targeted journalists for their work.
ISIS managed to change the course of the war through the precise, vicious use of violence, especially in documenting the beheading of Western journalists and promoting those videos through media channels.
The fog of war doesn’t simply happen; combatants contribute to it strategically, with their attempts to mystify and confuse adversaries.
Against the forces of misinformation, finding and building coherent narratives about the war is an immense challenge.
We now know the principles and techniques for organizing, prioritizing and verifying information coming out of Syria.
We can identify facts and establish evidence through careful analysis, and with media forensics techniques such as reverse image search, geolocation and metadata analysis.
We can build and maintain trusted relationships with friends, colleagues and sources who are proximate to the conflict.
We can know a lot about this war, but simply knowing facts isn’t nearly enough to change its course.
Demonstrated facts do not necessarily influence the outcome of events. That is the essence of understanding power, and its limits.

Recently, the Malaysian soccer team had reason to cheer when it reached the finals of the Asean Football Federation Suzuki Cup for the first time in 14 years by beating defending champion Vietnam, and beat Indonesia 3-0 in the first leg of the final that was played at the Bukit Jalil National Stadium.
However, Indonesian fans complained that Malaysian fans had distracted the Indonesian players by pointing laser lights at them, and showed their dissatisfaction through Twitter.
Two hashtags made it into the worldwide trending topics, ‘Hate Malaysia’ and ‘#loveindonesia’.
Yopy Rinaldi blogged that the win by Malaysia was not special, as they had cheated when the referee did not take action against fans who used the laser light to distract the Indonesian goalkeeper.
The defeat in the match Indonesia vs Malaysia aff suzuki cup is not an embarrassing defeat. malaysia cheating fans who do not support towards this match, and the referee did not seem wise here at malaysia violations, resulting in the fall of Indonesia in this aff suzuki cup match.
However, jasonmumbles tweeted that ‘We, Malaysians, are ashamed of the laser incident but you can't say we cheat because we only scored AFTER the incident’.
While many took to Twitter to protest Malaysia's alleged cheating, some tried to reason that such an incident is no cause for harsh words.
PrinceofPopJB tweeted 'Asians were #Family right ?? if we are #Family STOP HATIN' EACH OTHER .
STOP HATE MALAYSIA just #LoveMalaysia and #LoveIndonesia :)'
Apmaaaar also tweeted that the reaction from many Indonesians was uncalled for.
'We LOVE INDONESIA, we PROUD OF INDONESIA, but we dont need to HATE MALAYSIA.
Stop blaming and walk on!!'
The second leg of the final will be played at the Gelora Bung Karno Stadium in Jakarta on the 29th of December, and Indonesia needs to score at least four goals to win the title.
